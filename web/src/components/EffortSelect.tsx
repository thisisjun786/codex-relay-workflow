/** Reasoning-effort dropdown. "" = inherit the parent session's effort (null).
 *  Values mirror the codex spawn wire enum; an invalid effort would hard-fail
 *  the spawn, so only these are offered.
 *
 *  `supported` is THREE-state and must stay that way: an array is the model's
 *  advertised ladder, `undefined` means no model is selected, and `null` means the
 *  source did not advertise a ladder. Only an array may disable an option - folding
 *  `null` into `[]` would grey out every effort for a model whose ladder is not
 *  reported, which is a live state on real rosters. */
