# repo-map

RepoMap generates a compact symbol overview for a repository or subtree. It uses
tree-sitter tag queries to find definitions and references, then ranks files and
symbols with PageRank over the reference graph. The implementation is vendored
from Pete Davis' RepoMapper and keeps the Aider lineage for the `.scm` tag
queries.

Reach for it before deep `rg` dives when you are entering unfamiliar C2+ code and
need the project shape: important files, definitions, cross-file reference
gravity, and the likely architectural center of a subtree.

## rg and ast-grep boundaries

Use `rg` for text, filenames, comments, literal strings, and byte-level regex
searches.

Use `crw-ast-grep` for shape search and deterministic rewrites: function/call
patterns, imports, syntax-aware migrations, and codemods.

Use this skill for an overview map, not for exact search. The map is a guide for
where to inspect next, not proof that a symbol is absent.

## When to use this skill

- "Give me a repo map of this package."
- "I am in unfamiliar code; show me the structure first."
- "What files define the main symbols in this subtree?"
- "Build an architecture map before changing this module."
- "와꾸 먼저 보자."

## CLI usage

Preferred:

```bash
crw map .
crw map src/ --budget 2048
```

Direct script:

```bash
python3 "<crw-repo-map skill directory>/scripts/repomap.py" .
python3 "<crw-repo-map skill directory>/scripts/repomap.py" src/ --budget 2048
```

Useful flags:

Note: compiled-output dirs (`dist`, `build`, `target`, `out`, `coverage`) are
skipped during directory expansion. If a repo's real sources live there, pass
the path explicitly (e.g. `crw map dist/`) to map it anyway.

```bash
--map-tokens N      # token budget; default 4096
--budget N          # alias for --map-tokens
--chat-files ...    # files currently in focus, ranked higher
--mentioned-idents  # symbols to boost
--verbose           # stderr summary: files, defs, refs
```

## Dependencies

`crw map` resolves its Python dependencies through a bootstrap ladder, so in most
environments no manual install is needed:

1. `CRW_PYTHON` env override — that interpreter is used verbatim.
2. `uv` on PATH — the script runs via `uv run --with-requirements`, and deps
   resolve into uv's own rebuildable cache automatically (first run pays a short
   resolve; later runs are warm).
3. An existing venv at `$CRW_HOME|~/.crw/venvs/repomap` — a user-level
   rebuildable derived cache (philosophy §2). Auto-created only when
   `CRW_MAP_BOOTSTRAP=1` is set (opt-in network install). A venv is ready only
   when its completion marker `.crw-ready` exists in the venv directory; the
   bootstrap writes it (atomically) after `pip install` succeeded. A venv without
   the marker (one built before the marker existed, or one whose bootstrap was
   killed or failed) is not used: a run without `CRW_MAP_BOOTSTRAP=1` goes on to
   rung 4, and the next run with `CRW_MAP_BOOTSTRAP=1` builds it again once
   (`python3 -m venv` over the directory, then `pip install`) and marks it ready.
   Nothing else in the directory is deleted, and a failed attempt removes only
   what it made.
4. Bare `python3` — works when deps are already installed; otherwise degrades to
   the install hint below.

Manual install (rung 4 environments):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r "<crw-repo-map skill directory>/scripts/requirements.txt"
```

The CLI degrades cleanly when dependencies are missing. `--help` works with only
system Python and always bypasses the ladder (dep-free help contract). A real map
run without parser dependencies prints a single install hint and exits with code 3.

The pinned parser stack matters: `tree-sitter-language-pack==0.9.0` and
`tree-sitter==0.25.1` are the verified working pair for this vendored parser API.

## Cache

RepoMap stores derived tag cache data under:

```text
.crw/cache/repomap/tags.v1
```

Set `CRW_REPOMAP_CACHE` to override the location. The cache is rebuildable
derived data. It is wiped only by `crw pabcd reset --all`.

## Verification tiers

Locally fixture-verified: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Rust.

Other languages inherit the vendored Aider-tested `.scm` tag queries on a
best-effort basis. Treat those maps as orientation, then inspect the files they
surface.

## Notes

- On-demand skill (`allow_implicit_invocation: false`); reached by trigger or
  explicit use.
- Discoverability: a SessionStart hook
  (the crw SessionStart map-affordance hook) announces this
  tool's existence once per session when the repo clears a source-file size gate.
  That is a POINTER only — the map body is never session-injected (on-demand stays
  the rule). This is the runtime companion to the `dev` §1.5 DEV-MAP-FIRST-01
  routing, which is model-autonomous.
- Stateless one-shot CLI: no daemon, server, MCP process, background indexer, or
  workspace watcher.
- Lazygap 005 compliant: no dependency import or runtime setup is required for
  `--help`; heavy Python modules load only after argument parsing.
