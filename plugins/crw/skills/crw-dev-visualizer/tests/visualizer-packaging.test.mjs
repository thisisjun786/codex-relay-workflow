// visualizer-packaging.test.mjs — issues #182 and #183.
//
// dev-visualizer shipped four kinds of reference that a standalone consumer cannot
// resolve: sibling links into ../dev/, a prose dependency on the same file that a
// Markdown link checker would miss, and repository-only devlog pointers. The skill
// looked fine in this repo and broke the moment it was copied on its own.
//
// These tests operate on an ISOLATED COPY of the skill directory, because that is the
// only way to observe the defect: inside the repo, every one of those paths resolves.
