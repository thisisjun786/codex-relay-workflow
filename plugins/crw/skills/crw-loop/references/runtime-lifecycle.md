## Orchestrate mandate (ORCH-MANDATE-01, STRICT)

A loop claim without persisted FSM evidence is INVALID. Narrating phases ("now I'm in
B", "audit passed") without their `crw pabcd orchestrate` transitions is the exact
failure mode this rule exists to stop: the Stop hook never arms, the ledger stays
empty, and the "loop" is one ordinary turn wearing a loop costume. Mandatory sequence
for EVERY loop entry or re-entry:

1. Use YOUR current SessionStart binding (SESSION-IDENTITY-01). When native
   CODEX_THREAD_ID is present, corroborate it with `crw relay session current` before
   mutation. Missing, inherited or conflicting line: run `crw relay session current`,
   then explicit `crw relay session bind` from the verified native cwd. Never set the
   environment ID yourself, choose latest state or replay a synthetic hook event.
   If validation fails, report it and continue independently authorized work.
   Binding creates missing FSM state only; it does not verify hooks or arm Stop.
2. `crw pabcd orchestrate status --session <id>` — read the real phase before claiming any.
3. For a new authorized HOTL goal: create_goal, crw pabcd loop init, register the plan,
   then enter P. On resume, inspect and reuse the matching active goal and bound
   plan; do not recreate or overwrite them. Resolve a mismatched goal/scope first.
   HITL enters I or P only within the requested scope and without a host goal.
4. Advance the four gated work edges (P>A, A>B, B>C, C>D) with
   `crw pabcd orchestrate <phase> --attest <json>` — or `--attest-file <path>`, which is
   REQUIRED on Windows because PowerShell cannot pass inline JSON as one argument —
   carrying the phase's real artifact
   (ORCH-ARTIFACT-01). Every attest names the edge it advances with `from`/`to`,
   plus that edge's own keys (`planUnit` on P>A, `workPhaseId` on every gated edge
   under a bound goalplan, `testReceiptPath` on C>D) — canonical table and
   copy-paste objects: [Phase control](../../crw-pabcd/references/phase-control.md) (ATTEST-SHAPE-01).
   Entry edges (IDLE→P, I→P) are explicit commands without an
   attest JSON — the shipped gate (`dist/attest.js` GATED_TRANSITIONS) gates exactly
   those four. A phase without its persisted transition did not happen — the
   footer/ledger is the only proof of phase.
5. After D closes to IDLE, read durable state (goalplan + ledger) to confirm remaining
   work, then re-enter P for the next work-phase with
   `crw pabcd orchestrate P --session <id>`.

Work performed outside the FSM does not count as loop progress: re-enter and attest
it before building on it. Runtime companions (shipped): a loop/goalplan/
continue-until-done request hitting an UN-ARMED FSM gets the arming mandate injected
at prompt time (`LOOP_ARM_DIRECTIVE`, hook `UserPromptSubmit`), except that a request naming a
project or a coordination gets a short scope pointer instead (crw-run for the project parent,
crw-loop only for an explicit implementation of a task in this session; the pointer arms
nothing), and an active goal
with no in-flight cycle gets the Stop-time block naming the arming command
(GOAL-IDLE-CONTINUE-01) — but neither companion moves a phase for you; the commands
remain yours to run.

## Completion gate (GOAL-COMPLETE-GATE-01, shipped)

`update_goal {status:"complete"}` is gated by a deterministic PreToolUse hook,
not just discipline text. The hook DENIES the call when:

- a PABCD cycle is in flight (`orchestrationActive`, phase not IDLE/I) — close
  the cycle through D (or `crw pabcd orchestrate reset`) first; or
- the session-bound goalplan fails the E8 gate (`crw pabcd loop validate`): undone
  work phases, unmet criteria, `met` marks without `capturedEvidence`, or an
  empty unregistered plan.

The plugin's completion gate does not deny blocked status; this does not override
the host tool's blocked-status conditions or authorize an early stop. The gate is
fail-open on IO errors and does not fire without state or a bound goalplan.
Do not shrink the goalplan to pass the gate (LOOP-CONTINUE-01).

Before waiting on dispatched work or long external processes, read
[Waiting on work](waiting.md), the mode-neutral owner of wait and retirement rules.
It also owns the cross-turn preflight: the Stop-continuation bounds below mean a
dispatch expected to outlive this turn needs a verified wake arranged BEFORE the turn
yields, not an assumption that something will resume the coordinator.

## Stop-continuation (shipped, L6)

The active Stop hook (`handleStop`) returns `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` under
an ACTIVE goal, including at IDLE when GOAL-IDLE-CONTINUE-01 names the next arming
command and remaining work. Termination remains bounded by:

- **Goal/phase guard** — no active goal → release (a plain interactive session never enters
  the loop; it pauses for the human at P/A/B, and IDLE without a goal stays silent).
  Phase `I` always releases (the Interview is HITL-only).
- **Context-pressure bail** — don't pile on during compaction recovery.
- **Stagnation cap** — a bounded `stopBlockCount` per phase; after `MAX_STOP_BLOCKS`
  consecutive blocks at the same phase with no transition, the loop releases so it can
  never trap a session, and it stays released at that phase and work-phase for the rest
  of the user turn, even when another Stop hook keeps the turn going. A real transition
  (chat or CLI), a switch of the active work-phase, a metric row that beats the previous
  row of its own metric and work-phase, or a new user turn resets the counter, so each
  phase of a healthy P→A→B→C→D gets a fresh budget. This is the runtime companion to
  LOOP-DOOM-01, not a success signal; after release, apply the no-progress discipline
  before retrying the same phase.
- **Objective plateau block** — for active maximize goals with session-scoped metrics,
  two non-improving same-metric rows switch the block reason from plain continuation
  to "step back and re-plan with divergence." With a bound goalplan only the active
  work-phase's rows (and rows recorded without `--work-phase`) count, and one evaluation
  window asks once: the next Stop continues normally until a new metric row opens a new
  window. This still uses the same bounded
  `MAX_STOP_BLOCKS` release path and never asks the user inside goal mode.

### Stop decision matrix

| Condition | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| No active goal, or phase I | Release |
| Active goal + in-flight cycle | Bounded block (continue phase) |
| Active goal + IDLE with remaining work | Block with arming command |
| Context pressure or stagnation cap exhausted | Release (not a success signal) |
