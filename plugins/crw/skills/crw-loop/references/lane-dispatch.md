# Lane dispatch — tasks that run their own loop

Read when a request fans work out across parallel tasks, or when watching more lanes than
one wait can hold. [Dispatch surfaces](../../crw-pabcd/references/dispatch-surfaces.md) owns
the choice between a thread and a subagent; this file owns what a lane is handed and what
it is allowed to do with it.

The numbers below were read from the Codex desktop bundle and the `codex-rs` sources on
2026-09-20 and are recorded as data in `examples/host-thread-bounds.json`. Re-derive
them with `node "<crw-loop skill directory>/scripts/check-host-bounds.mjs"` rather
than trusting this prose. Resolve the skill directory from the loaded SKILL.md;
the example keeps the recorded values but omits the original personal source
locator. Supply available artifacts through `checkBounds(fixture, options)`;
missing artifacts remain NOT_RUN.

## LANE-LOOP-AUTH-01 (STRICT) — a lane may loop; a leaf never may

A subagent has no session state, no host goal and no FSM: it must not call `create_goal`
or `crw pabcd orchestrate`. A dispatched task does own both, because crw keys them to the
task. Ownership is not authority, though. A lane runs a PABCD loop only when its packet
grants an objective, criteria and a completion condition; with no such grant it does the
stated work and reports. The coordinator never advances a lane's FSM and a lane never
advances the coordinator's — messaging a task is not commanding it.

## LANE-PACKET-01 (DEFAULT) — the prompt is the whole channel

A lane cannot read the coordinator's goalplan, ledger or context. Whatever is not in the
`create_thread` prompt does not exist for it. The packet therefore carries:

| Field | Why it is required |
|---|---|
| `lane` | The lane id used in the manifest, so two records can be matched later |
| `mode` | `dispatch`, `pending`, or `bound`; creation evidence requires an explicit mode in the packet or CLI |
| `address.threadId`, `address.hostId` | How anyone addresses this lane afterwards. Present only once creation has returned them |
| `creation.provisionalId`, `creation.hostId`, `creation.requestedAt` | Required in pending; records the requested creation without claiming a canonical address |
| `creation.worktree` | Optional nonempty string when the worktree is known |
| `work.objective`, `work.criteria[]` | Required when the lane is told to loop; a loop without them is an instruction to invent a goal |
| `work.writeScope[]` | What this lane may write. Overlapping scopes are how two lanes silently fight |
| `work.base`, `work.branch` | The ref it starts from and the branch it owns |
| `authority.loop` | Default false. False means work and report |
| `authority.push`, `authority.openPr` | Default false. A pull request needs a pushed branch, and merge needs both |
| `authority.merge`, `authority.mergeTarget` | Default false. See below |
| `reporting.evidence[]`, `reporting.onBlocked` | What must come back, and what to do instead of guessing |

A packet has three states. `dispatch` is before creation and cannot carry creation
evidence or provisional address fields. `pending` means creation was requested but the
canonical id is unconfirmed: it requires `creation` and forbids the `address` property
entirely, even an empty or null value. `bound` requires a canonical address and may retain
validated creation evidence. These records do not resolve ids or replay creation requests.

For compatibility, a packet without `mode` or `creation` defaults to `bound` when its
address is an object and `dispatch` otherwise. A present malformed or empty mode fails;
creation evidence requires an explicit pending/bound mode in the packet or CLI. A CLI
mode that conflicts with the declared mode fails rather than relabeling the record.

`creation.provisionalId` is a nonempty string, and `creation.hostId` uses the same charset
as `address.hostId`. `creation.requestedAt` must be a real calendar timestamp in canonical
UTC form `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss[.sss]Z`, with exactly three fractional digits if supplied.
Offsets, normalized impossible dates and local timestamps are rejected. For example:

```json
{
  "mode": "pending",
  "creation": {
    "provisionalId": "<clientThreadId>",
    "hostId": "local",
    "requestedAt": "2026-09-22T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

This fragment accompanies the packet's required lane, work and reporting fields.

Validate with `node "<crw-loop skill directory>/scripts/check-lane-packet.mjs" <packet.json>
[--mode dispatch|pending|bound] [--json]`. Options may precede or follow the single file;
missing values, duplicate options, unknown flags/modes and extra files are rejected.
Single-packet JSON includes `resolved.mode`, and successful text output prints `mode=...`.
Validate a mixed-state set together — it also rejects two lanes sharing
a lane id or a branch, and compares write scopes after normalizing `.` and `..` so an
aliased path cannot hide an overlap.

What it cannot do: tell a provisional id from a canonical one by shape, because they have
none. It can only refuse an `address.clientThreadId` and refuse a `threadId` that repeats
either `creation.provisionalId` or the legacy `address.provisionalId`. Keep new provisional
records in `creation.provisionalId`; copying a value never establishes canonical identity.

## LANE-MERGE-GRANT-01 (STRICT) — merge is a separate sentence

The default is evidence-return: the lane pushes its branch, opens a PR when its packet
says so, and hands back CI evidence; the coordinator sequences landing
(DISPATCH-LANE-MERGE-01). A lane granted merge may land only the branch named in
`authority.mergeTarget`, which must be its own. Nothing about holding a worktree implies
permission to rewrite, retarget or merge another lane's branch.

## Addressing a lane

A lane is a canonical `threadId` plus a `hostId`. The user-facing mention the app builds
is `[@Title](thread://<threadId>?hostId=<encoded hostId>)`; the thread id accepts only
`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` and the host id is percent-encoded and must decode to `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`.
Several tasks can be referenced in one turn: duplicates collapse by `(hostId, threadId)`
and the turn carries the resolved list as JSON under `## Referenced chats with Codex:`.
No cap was found on that path when it was read — collection, resolution and injection all
pass the whole array — which is a measured absence rather than a guarantee. A reference is
a pointer, not content: read the task before relying on it.

Creation is asynchronous. A ready task returns `threadId` and `hostId`; a task whose
worktree is still being set up returns a provisional `clientThreadId`, which no tool
accepts. The binding to the canonical id exists internally, but no model-visible resolver
was found when the bundle was searched, so treat it as unavailable rather than hidden.
Record it as `creation.provisionalId` in a pending packet. A listing can supply candidates,
but title, cwd or elapsed time alone cannot establish the mapping. Confirm canonical
identity through host evidence and read-only inspection; otherwise leave the packet
pending. An absent listing, failure or long delay never authorizes recreating the lane.

## Watching lanes, and the wave that is actually capped

`wait_threads` takes **1-8 targets** with `timeoutMs` **0-120000** (default 120000). It
wakes on the first target that completes or needs attention; commentary never wakes it and
a timeout returns compact progress for every target, which is a normal outcome rather than
a failure. More than eight lanes means deliberate batching: watch the batch whose result
changes your next decision, carry each target's `afterCursor`, and do not read an
unwatched lane as idle.

Fan-out **across branches** belongs to lanes, not to subagents; concurrency *inside* one
lane's tree is still subagent work. No host-wide cap on concurrently running tasks was
found in the searched paths, and per-thread turns queue instead. Subagents are the capped
resource:
spawning past the limit fails outright with `agent thread limit reached`, and the limit is
six per session by default (`agents.max_threads`; on V2,
`features.multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session` minus one for the session
itself). So "unlimited parallel subagents" is not a shape the host offers — run waves,
state the wave size, and close finished agents, because a completed agent holds its slot
until it is closed.

## Nothing wakes the coordinator

A finished lane notifies its own task. No cross-task wake was found. A coordinator that
dispatches lanes and ends its turn has arranged nothing: keep the work inside the turn,
or arm a wake that targets the coordinator itself and verify it is active
(DISPATCH-WAKE-01 in [waiting](waiting.md)). Only one active heartbeat may attach to a
thread, so a second monitor is not a second safety net.

Managed worktrees are retained to the latest 15 by default and archive cleanup can delete
or transfer one, so a lane's checkout is not permanent storage. Land or push work; do not
leave the only copy in a worktree nobody owns.

## Known limitation

`check-lane-packet.mjs` decides packets; it does not police this document. The
authorization in [crw-loop](../SKILL.md) is prose, and no test fails when prose is
deleted — an independent reviewer raised exactly that, and closing it properly means
enforcing the packet at the orchestration boundary, which is a runtime change this
contract does not make. Treat the validator as the enforceable half and the skill text as
the readable half.
