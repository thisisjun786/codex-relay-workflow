## HOTL Goal-Setting Rule

When entering HOTL mode, the main agent MUST create a host goal with
`create_goal` before relying on Stop-continuation. The objective should be
detailed, concrete, and approach the host limit of 4000 characters.

The objective must include:

- The concrete outcome to achieve.
- The file change scope and explicit out-of-scope boundaries.
- Acceptance criteria, including what counts as `DONE`, `NOOP`, `BLOCKED`,
  `UNSAFE`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`, or `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`.
- Verification commands or evidence artifacts expected before each completion claim.
- The expected terminal outcome and the first work-phase to run.

A vague or short objective under 500 characters is a discipline violation for
HOTL mode.

Token limit: pass `token_budget` to `create_goal` only when the user named a token
limit, with exactly that value; never choose one yourself. With no limit named the
goal is unlimited. The host validates the field and its value. A host whose
`create_goal` does not accept `token_budget` is a reported capability conflict;
do not create the goal without the limit the user asked for. The `create_goal`
hook does not refuse the field, and `update_goal` is not a budget API.

After `create_goal`, run `crw pabcd loop init --objective "<same text>"
--session <id>` to create the durable local plan bound to the session.

After `loop init`, REGISTER the plan: fill `workPhases[]` (with tasks) and
`criteria[]` in the goalplan file before the first work-phase. An init-only
empty plan now FAILS `crw pabcd loop validate` (E8), and `update_goal
{status:"complete"}` is hook-denied while the bound goalplan fails that gate
(GOAL-COMPLETE-GATE-01) — an unregistered plan cannot certify completion.

## Durable Goalplan

Use a durable goalplan when a CRW loop needs more than a chat-local
checklist: goals, work phases, success criteria, checkpoints, evidence,
Interview OPEN ASSUMPTIONS, steering decisions, and quality gates.

### Contract

- Represent goals, work phases, success criteria, checkpoints, and evidence.
- Carry Interview OPEN ASSUMPTIONS (`proposed` and `open` entries, with source,
  confidence, consequence if wrong and status) into Plan/Audit instead of dropping
  them. Confirmed requirements and rejected assumptions travel in their own plan
  sections with their answer reference (INTERVIEW-ASSUME-01 in crw-interview).
- Record steering decisions with rationale and evidence.
- Reject steering that weakens completion criteria or verification.
- Require a quality gate before final completion.

### Shipped schema

This is the on-disk shape under `.crw/goalplans/<slug>/goalplan.json`
(+ `ledger.jsonl`). Fill these fields; do not invent parallel ones:

- `objective`, `slug`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
- `workPhases[]` — each `{ id, title, status: pending|in_progress|done, dependsOn?, tasks[], criteriaIds[] }`.
  `workPhase.dependsOn` names prerequisite work phases. Optional `workPhase.awaitsDecision?: string[]` names decisions that must be answered before this phase can run. `activeWorkPhaseId` marks the current one.
  `workPhases[]` is APPEND-friendly mid-loop: when a new independent unit is discovered
  (LOOP-UNIT-CHAIN-01), add its work-phase (+ criteria) as a P-phase amendment instead of
  treating the plan as frozen at init or ending the goal.
  `tasks[]` are `{ id, title, status: pending|done, dependsOn?, outcome? }`.
  Task ids and task dependency references are phase-local: `task.dependsOn` names existing task ids in
  the same work phase, never a task in another phase. A done task carries a non-empty `outcome`; a pending
  task has no outcome.
- Optional `decisions[]` — each `{ id, question, recommendation?, options?, status: open|decided, answer?, askedAt, decidedAt? }`. When `options` is present it is a non-empty list of distinct entries and `recommendation` must be one of them; the answer stays free text because the host always offers a free-form reply. Open decisions have no answer or decidedAt; decided decisions require both. Decision ids are short lowercase ids. Absent and empty arrays remain distinct on disk, as do absent and empty `awaitsDecision` arrays. Old plans acquire neither field on read/write. Only linked pending or in-progress phases wait; an unrelated open decision does not pause the goal.
- `criteria[]` — each `{ id, scenario, surface, presented?, expectedEvidence, capturedEvidence, status: open|met }`.
  `scenario` is the `--criterion` text and `surface` is one of `logic` (default),
  `web`, `tui` or `desktop`, set by `add-criterion --surface` on a session-bound plan
  (`init` refuses `--surface`). `presented: "native"` is legal only with
  `surface: "desktop"` and activates the soft native observation advisory.
  `web`, `tui` and `desktop` make the QA receipt
  mandatory through validation on schemaVersion 2+ plans with a final gate and through
  the final-gate spawn guard on any plan with a recorded finalGate; otherwise the value
  is a classification. Builds older than 0.2.37 drop `desktop` on read and erase it on
  their next write; builds older than 0.2.38 do the same to `presented`. `id` is auto-assigned and `status` is derived. `expectedEvidence` has no
  CLI flag on `add-criterion` — it stays `""` unless set via a steering batch op or a
  hand edit — so do not plan on passing it. `capturedEvidence` is written by
  `meet-criterion --evidence`. A criterion only reaches `met` when `capturedEvidence`
  is non-empty (fresh proof, not memory).
- `host` — `GoalplanHostLink { armed, armedAt, source: freeze|none }`. `armed` is provenance,
  intended to read true only after a freeze-boundary arm (the MAIN session created a host goal).
  No shipped CLI flips it automatically and crw never writes the goal DB itself; treat it
  as the slot that records that boundary, not an auto-managed flag.

### CLI surface

- `crw pabcd loop init --objective <text> [--session <id>] [--criterion <text>]... [--schema-version <n>] [--cwd <path>]` —
  creates the local artifact and binds it to the session when a session id is
  supplied; it never writes the host goal DB. Repeat `--criterion` once per
  criterion to register them at init.
- `crw pabcd loop show (--slug <slug> | --objective <text> | --session <id>) [--cwd <path>]` — renders the current plan summary.
- `crw pabcd loop validate (--slug <slug> | --objective <text> | --session <id>) [--cwd <path>]` — runs the E8 quality gate; it FAILS
  unless the plan is complete and every `met` criterion carries `capturedEvidence`.
- `crw pabcd loop steer --session <id> --batch-json <path-or-json> [--cwd <path>]` — applies one
  batch once per `idempotencyKey`. Sending the same batch again under the same key applies nothing
  and records any ledger row the first attempt could not write; a different batch under a recorded
  key is refused, so give different content a new key. The goalplan keeps each batch's ops, an
  `annotate` note included, and `show` lists the notes.
- `crw pabcd loop add-criterion --session <id> --criterion <text> [--surface logic|web|tui|desktop] [--presented native] [--cwd <path>]` —
  registers a criterion whose scenario is the `--criterion` text. There is no `--id`:
  ids are assigned as `c-1`, `c-2`, ... (max existing `c-N` + 1, in registration
  order). A duplicate scenario text is rejected. `--presented native` requires `--surface desktop`.
- `crw pabcd loop add-work-phase --session <id> --id <id> --title <text> [--depends-on <id>]... [--cwd <path>]`
- `crw pabcd loop ready (--slug <slug> | --objective <text> | --session <id>) [--json] [--cwd <path>]`
- `crw pabcd loop add-task --session <id> --work-phase <id> --id <id> --title <text> [--depends-on <task-id>]... [--cwd <path>]`
- `crw pabcd loop complete-task --session <id> --work-phase <id> --id <id> --outcome <text> [--cwd <path>]`
- `crw pabcd loop ask --session <id> --id <id> --question <text> [--recommendation <text>] [--option <text>]... [--work-phase <id>]... [--cwd <path>]` — record a question after sending it through the host. It never sends a message. Name each dependent phase.
- `crw pabcd loop decide --session <id> --id <id> --answer <text> [--cwd <path>]` — record the user reply. This changes only the decision record; phase status and blockedReason stay as they were.
- `crw pabcd loop meet-criterion --session <id> --id <id> --evidence <text> [--cwd <path>]` — `--id` takes
  a generated `c-N` id; read it from `crw pabcd loop show` or the goalplan file.

The parser rejects unknown flags, stray positionals, missing values, and flags belonging to another verb before dispatch. Every value flag also accepts `--flag=value`, which is the way to pass a value that starts with `--`.

`ready --json` includes `openDecisions` and `awaitingDecisions` when the plan has a decisions field; `show` displays each open question and its waiting phases. At IDLE, Stop releases when every remaining phase and unmet criterion waits on an open user decision; the goal remains active and completion is still gated.

Repeat `--depends-on` once per prerequisite; comma-separated values are one id. Existing dependencies are
not edited after creation. `complete-task` and `meet-criterion` require non-empty proof text.

Ledger events are `created`, `workphase_started`, `workphase_done`, `task_done`, `criterion_met`,
`dependency_registered`, and `host_armed`. `dependency_registered` records only accepted definitions.

### Goal state

The host owns goal state in `goals_1.sqlite`; crw reads it read-only to decide
HITL vs HOTL. A goalplan records work phases, criteria, evidence, and assumptions; it
is not another goal database.

## HOTL resource bounds

Goal-mode loops are unattended. The P-phase loop-spec for each HOTL work-phase must
state the tool/credential scope, write scope, token/cost budget, and wall-clock bound.
For C4 surfaces, an unstated unattended scope is an ESCALATE-class omission: stop and
ask before starting or continuing the loop. Hitting a resource bound is
`BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, not `DONE`.
A token limit the user named is the host goal's `token_budget` (see the HOTL Goal-Setting Rule),
and a goal the host moves to `budgetLimited` stays limited at that number; a resume
or a raised limit is the user's decision, never the loop's.
