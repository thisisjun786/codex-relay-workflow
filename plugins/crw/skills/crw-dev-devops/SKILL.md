# Dev-DevOps — Production Infrastructure & Delivery

> **Backend handoff rule:** When a deploy/SRE gate needs app behavior, `dev-backend` implements
> the hook (health handler, readiness dependency check, trace/span/log fields, migration
> compatibility, shutdown hook). `dev-devops` defines the operational gate, rollout/rollback
> behavior, alert policy, and release proof. This skill owns deployment strategy, rollback
> proof, observability operations, health/readiness operational gates, SLOs, incident response,
> and infrastructure/runtime delivery.


Build reliable, secure, and automated infrastructure and delivery pipelines.
This skill is a routing role that activates by **change-surface**: whenever the work primarily touches containers, CI/CD, deployment, cloud/runtime infrastructure, Kubernetes, IaC, release engineering, or SRE operations, use this skill and then load the relevant references.

> **C0/C1 work (small local patches):** See `dev` §0.0 Work Classifier + §0.1 Patch Fast-Path before reading references.

> **`dev` is canonical:** `dev` §0.2 Rule Classes, §3 Verification Gate, and §5 Safety Rules apply to all work governed by this skill.

Severity and rule authority are distinct (`dev` §0.2). Safety/correctness and release
proof remain mandatory; architecture/tool preferences need project-specific justification.

Read `package-release.md` for package publishing, registry auth, npm/PyPI
trusted publishing, Bun-to-npm release decisions, and downstream package
channels. Read `cross-platform-release.md` when a release claim depends on
OS-local behavior that CI may not prove. Read `homebrew.md` for Formula/Cask
distribution work. Read `platform-engineering.md` for broader DevOps capability
refresh, DORA, provider routing, and platform guardrails. Read `docker.md` + `ci-cd-deploy.md` first for containerized deploy workflows.
For K8s-specific work, add `kubernetes.md`. For SRE/on-call, add `sre-foundations.md`.

When release, registry-auth, provider-doc, service-status, image/platform
version, or package-manager behavior depends on current external evidence, read
the active `search` skill and follow its source-fetch and evidence-status rules
instead of relying on stale memory or copied snippets.

## §1 Container Builds

### §1.1 Dockerfile Rules (STRICT)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Multi-stage | Separate build and runtime stages; final image has no build tools |
| Base image | Pin version + SHA256 digest: `node:22-slim@sha256:abc...` |
| Distroless | Prefer `gcr.io/distroless/*` for runtime; no shell, no package manager |
| Non-root | `USER nonroot:nonroot` (distroless) or create dedicated user |
| Dependency-first copy | `COPY package.json bun.lock ./` → install → `COPY . .` for layer caching |
| BuildKit secrets | `RUN --mount=type=secret,id=token ...` — never use `ARG` for secrets |
| `.dockerignore` | `.git`, `node_modules`, `.env*`, `*.log`, `dist/`, `coverage/`, `__pycache__/` |

For canonical Dockerfile templates, read `references/docker.md` §1.

### §1.2 Image Security (STRICT)

CRITICAL/HIGH image findings block push under this image policy. General checklist
exception language does not waive this gate: changing it needs a separately approved,
predeclared security policy, never an exception invented in the failing release report. Read
`references/docker.md` §4 for scan/SBOM/sign command examples, and
`../crw-dev-security/references/supply-chain-sbom.md` for deeper SBOM/signing
policy.

### §1.3 Anti-Patterns

| Banned | Symptom | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| `FROM node:latest` | Irreproducible builds | Pinned version + digest |
| `USER root` in final stage | Attack surface | Non-root user |
| `COPY . .` as first instruction | Cache invalidation on every change | Dependency files first |
| `ARG SECRET=xxx` | Exposed in image history | BuildKit `--mount=type=secret` |
| No scan before push | Vulnerable images in prod | Trivy/Scout CI gate |
| `apt-get install` without cleanup | Bloated image | `--no-install-recommends && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` |

---

## §2 Deploy Pipeline

### §2.1 Pipeline Stages (DEFAULT)

```
[dev-testing §5]  lint → typecheck → test → contract → e2e
[dev-devops]      build-image → scan → push-registry → deploy-staging → smoke → promote → deploy-prod
```

**Stacked-PR CI preflight (DEFAULT).** For stack sizing, repeated runs or missing
checks, follow `DEV-STACK-03/06/07` in
[`crw-dev`'s canonical stack reference](../crw-dev/references/stacked-prs.md).
Stack recognition also applies without this DevOps router; the global `dev` entry
owns it. Ordinary PRs/manual chains are the default. Do not suggest or adopt GitHub
native stacks without the user's clear, strong request for that feature in this task
(DEV-STACK-OPT-IN-01). Existing membership is a safety fact, not new authorization.
Keep membership and CI decisions in the canonical owner.

### §2.2 GHA Reusable Workflows (DEFAULT)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (caller)
jobs:
  build:
    uses: org/templates/.github/workflows/build-test.yml@v2
    with:
      service: payments
    secrets: inherit
```

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `workflow_call` | Central CI template, max 10-level nesting |
| Permissions | Caller cannot escalate; downgrade only |
| Environment | `environment: production` + required reviewers + prevent self-review |
| Promote | Digest-based (`image@sha256:...`), never mutable tags |

### §2.3 Deploy Strategies (DEFAULT)

| Strategy | Tool | When | Risk |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Rolling update | K8s Deployment | Stateless, low risk | Low |
| Blue-green | Argo Rollouts `blueGreen:` | Instant rollback, no DB migration | Medium |
| Canary | Argo Rollouts `canary: steps:` | Traffic % control, metric-based promote | Medium |
| Progressive | Flagger | Auto analysis + rollback, A/B testing | Medium-High |
| Feature flag | LaunchDarkly / Unleash | Code-level gradual rollout | Low |

### §2.4 Rollback Rules (STRICT)

- Every deployment must be rollback-capable within 5 minutes
- Digest-based promote only — mutable tags are banned
- DB migrations: forward-only + backward-compatible (expand-contract pattern)
- Post-rollback: automatic Slack/PagerDuty notification

### §2.5 Secret Management (STRICT)

**Rule (DEVOPS-AUTH-01):** Prefer OIDC, workload identity federation, trusted publishing, or other short-lived credential flows before static long-lived tokens. When static tokens are unavoidable, scope narrowly, store in the managed secret system, and rotate on schedule or incident.

| Source | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| GHA Secrets / Vault / AWS SM | CI pipeline secrets |
| External Secrets Operator | K8s → Vault/AWS SM sync |
| `.env` files | **Never committed** — generated in CI |
| Rotation | 90-day cycle or immediate on incident |

### §2.6 GitOps (DEFAULT)

- **Actions = CI, ArgoCD = CD** — separation of concerns
- Actions updates deploy repo (image digest PR/commit) → ArgoCD reconciles
- Self-heal: ArgoCD auto-reverts drift
- Environment protection: GitHub Environments for prod approval gate

### §2.7 Release Proof Contract (STRICT)

**Rule (DEVOPS-RELEASE-PROOF-01):** A release claim must name the artifact digest, workflow/builder identity, deploy target/environment, smoke-test evidence, and rollback evidence. Keep the proof at router level; detailed package, platform, and SLSA mechanics live in `package-release.md`, `cross-platform-release.md`, and `platform-engineering.md`.

---

### §2.8 Freeze & GO/NO-GO Gates (STRICT)

`DEVOPS-RELEASE-PROOF-01` governs the proof bundle for an artifact you already
published. This section governs the decision to publish at all — the readiness
report, and the gates it claims to have passed.

Sources: the OpenCodex v2.32.1 hotfix train and the operator-visibility train
that followed it (`devlog/_plan/260824_v2_32_1_hotfix_train/`,
`devlog/_plan/260825_operator_visibility_train/`). A freeze audit rejected the
first GO report there on three counts — unresolved review threads on merged PRs,
a red gate argued into an exception, and missing frozen-head receipts
(`900_go_nogo_readiness_report.md`:37-49).

| Rule | Severity | Statement |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `DEVOPS-FREEZE-SHA-01` | STRICT | Pin the readiness report to the code SHA its gates describe. If the head moved after the freeze, prove the delta is docs-only (`git diff --name-only <freeze> <head>`) and keep every gate receipt on the freeze SHA. |
| `DEVOPS-GATE-WEAKEN-01` | STRICT | A red named gate is never excused inside the report that gate failed. Make the original command green, or replace it with a pre-declared equivalent CI actually runs — and declare the swap **before** the verdict, not after the failure. |
| `DEVOPS-REVIEW-THREADS-01` | STRICT | Unresolved review threads on merged PRs are a GO blocker. Count them **after** merge: a thread opened minutes before merge still counts until it is fixed or explicitly dismissed. |
| `DEVOPS-GATE-OWNER-01` | STRICT | A mandatory GO gate needs an implementing work-phase and a recorded terminal outcome — pass, not-reproduced, or explicitly deregistered. A gate nobody implements is not a gate; it is a wish. |

Per-rule sources: FREEZE-SHA `900`:3-7; GATE-WEAKEN `900`:47-49; REVIEW-THREADS
`900`:40-46 and `080_wp8`:47; GATE-OWNER `090_wp9`:6-8 and
`000_baseline_scope_and_roadmap.md`:243-245.

**Why gate-weakening is the load-bearing rule.** In the case that produced it the
suite was red, the red tests were known to be load-sensitive, and the fix was
real — so the report explained the exception. The audit rejected that, correctly:
an exception argued *after* a gate fails is indistinguishable from an exception
argued *because* it failed. The honest move was to decompose the gate to match
what CI actually runs (`DEVOPS-SUITE-PARTITION-01`), which turned the general
suite green. One local `api-usage` failure remained and was waived separately,
on the `DEVOPS-BASELINE-DEFECT-01` triple — not by the partitioning.

Operational mechanics — suite partitioning, baseline-versus-defect attribution,
instrument stability, and exact-head evidence — live in
`references/ci-cd-deploy.md` §6. Runtime and operator-signal evidence rules live
in `references/sre-foundations.md` §7.

---

## §2.9 Branch Lifecycle Hygiene (STRICT)

This section guides explicitly requested branch-lifecycle work. A review or routine
feature change does not authorize changing host settings, creating scheduled jobs,
or deleting refs. Propose missing automation first; enact it only when authorized.

Delivery repositories accumulate dead refs, and the cost is not disk. Stale
branches make `git branch -r` unusable for triage, keep superseded heads
reachable by tooling that resolves names, and hide the handful of branches that
actually still matter. Treat branch lifecycle as delivery infrastructure.

| Rule | Severity | Statement |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `DEVOPS-BRANCH-AUTODELETE-01` | STRICT | Enable host-side head deletion on merge (`delete_branch_on_merge` on GitHub) **and** close the gap it leaves. That setting fires only on merge; a pull request closed without merging keeps its head branch forever, so the closed-PR case needs its own scheduled automation. |
| `DEVOPS-BRANCH-DELETE-EVIDENCE-01` | STRICT | Never bulk-prune. Before deleting any ref, prove per branch that it is not protected, not an open PR head, not the base of an open PR, not a fork head, and not carrying unique commits. A name pattern is not evidence. |
| `DEVOPS-BRANCH-SNAPSHOT-01` | STRICT | Snapshot `git for-each-ref` (SHA + refname) for every local and remote ref to scratch space before the first deletion. Deleted remote branches are restorable with `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/<name>` only while you still hold the SHA. |
| `DEVOPS-WORKTREE-DIRTY-01` | STRICT | Check every attached worktree for uncommitted work before removing it, and remove worktrees **before** their branches — an attached branch cannot be deleted, and `--force` on a dirty tree discards work no reflog will return. |
| `DEVOPS-BRANCH-NAMESPACE-01` | STRICT | Automation deletes only inside a declared disposable namespace (planner default `codex/`, `ingw/`; a repository may add prefixes such as `agent/`) and only when the branch tip still equals a closed PR's head SHA. A name match is not evidence; a reused name is new work. |
| `DEVOPS-REPO-BOOTSTRAP-01` | DEFAULT | A repository that receives agent PRs is set up ruleset-first: protected integration lines, auto-delete on merge, closed-PR cleanup job, merge-method policy, PR limits, labels and template, each verified by a read-back command. Owner: `references/repo-bootstrap.md`. |
| `DEVOPS-AGENT-INTAKE-01` | DEFAULT | Agent-authored PRs enter through a declared intake policy (weak, medium or strong) that names identity, draft rule, review budget, supersede procedure and close conditions. Owner: `references/agent-pr-intake.md`. |
| `DEVOPS-LOCAL-GC-01` | STRICT | Local worktree and branch GC uses PR state as merge truth, snapshots first, audits dirty trees, never touches the active or a locked worktree, and defaults to dry-run. Owner: `references/local-gc.md`. |

**Why the merged/closed distinction is load-bearing.** `delete_branch_on_merge`
reads as complete branch hygiene, and a repository with it enabled looks solved.
It is not: OpenCodex had the setting on and still carried 59 dead remote
branches, because closed-unmerged PRs are outside what that setting covers. The
failure is silent and compounds — nothing reports it, and the branch list simply
degrades until triage stops using it.

**Why stacked PRs break naive cleanup.** A stacked child PR targets its parent's
head branch. Deleting a closed parent *closes the open child*, so "the PR that
owned this branch is closed" is insufficient grounds for deletion. The base of
any open PR is protected regardless of its own PR state.

**Fork heads are out of scope, and identity is by repo id.** A fork's head lives
in the contributor's repository; deleting refs there is neither permitted nor
intended. Compare repository **ids**, not names — a fork commonly carries the
same branch names as upstream, so name comparison silently misclassifies it.

Mechanics, the deletion-plan algorithm, and a worked audit live in
`references/branch-lifecycle.md`. Setup, intake and local GC have their own owner
files, listed in Modular References above.

## §3 Kubernetes Basics

### §3.1 Minimum Viable K8s (DEFAULT)

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Deployment | Pod template + replica management |
| Service | Internal networking |
| HTTPRoute (Gateway API) | External traffic routing — **not Ingress** |
| ResourceQuota | Request/limit enforcement |
| Probes | Liveness + readiness + startup |
| Namespace | Environment isolation (dev/staging/prod) |

### §3.2 Gateway API (v1.6+, verified 2026-07-02 — TCPRoute/UDPRoute GA in v1.6)

Gateway API is the successor for new routing while Ingress remains GA but feature-frozen. Role separation: platform team owns `GatewayClass` + `Gateway`, app team owns `HTTPRoute`.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: payments-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: shared-gateway
  hostnames: ["payments.example.com"]
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path: { type: PathPrefix, value: /api }
      backendRefs:
        - name: payments-svc
          port: 8080
```

### §3.3 Scaling (DEFAULT)

| Mechanism | Scope | Watch |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| HPA | CPU/memory + custom metrics | Don't combine with VPA on same metric |
| VPA | Request auto-tuning | Use `Off` mode for recommendations only |
| PDB | Disruption budget | `minAvailable: 50%` or `maxUnavailable: 1` |

### §3.4 Anti-Patterns

| Banned | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| `Ingress` (new projects) | Gateway API `HTTPRoute` |
| No resource limits | Always set requests + limits |
| `image: app:latest` | SHA digest or pinned SemVer |
| Single replica in prod | Minimum 2 + PDB |
| Secrets in ConfigMap | K8s Secret + External Secrets Operator |
| Annotation-based routing | Gateway API native fields |

---

## §4 Infrastructure as Code

### §4.1 OpenTofu/Terraform Rules (DEFAULT)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| State | Remote backend required (S3+DynamoDB / TF Cloud / OpenTofu) |
| Encryption | OpenTofu native state/plan encryption via KMS |
| Blast radius | Separate state per app/layer/env |
| Modules | Purpose-built (vpc, iam, ecs-service), typed I/O |
| Apply | `plan` → PR review → `apply`; auto-apply staging only |
| Versions | Pin provider + module versions explicitly |

### §4.2 Tool Selection (HEURISTIC)

| Tool | Best For | 2026 Status |
|------|----------|-------------|
| OpenTofu (HCL) | Open-source/licensing-neutral IaC default (MPL-2.0, Linux Foundation) | ✅ Recommended for OSS neutrality |
| Terraform / HCP Terraform (BSL) | Vendor support or HashiCorp platform integration | ✅ Active (check BSL competitive-use terms) |
| Pulumi (TS/Python) | Teams preferring programming languages | ✅ Active |
| AWS CDK | AWS-only infrastructure | ✅ Active (AWS only) |
| **CDKTF** | — | ❌ Deprecated 2025-12-10; repo archived/read-only, no further fixes |

### §4.3 Anti-Patterns

| Banned | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Local state file | Remote backend required |
| Manual console changes | All changes via code |
| Hardcoded values | Variables + tfvars |
| Monolithic main.tf | Modular decomposition |
| CDKTF (new projects) | OpenTofu or Pulumi |
| Unpinned provider versions | Explicit version constraints |

---

## §5 SRE Foundations

### §5.1 SLO/SLI (DEFAULT)

| SLI | Measurement | Typical SLO |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Availability | Success requests / total | 99.9% (28-day rolling) |
| Latency | p50/p95/p99 response time | p99 < 500ms |
| Error rate | 5xx / total | < 0.1% |
| Freshness | Data update delay | < 5min (pipelines) |

SLIs measure **user experience**, not infrastructure metrics. "CPU is fine ≠ users are fine."

Error budget = 1 − SLO (99.9% → 0.1% budget).

**DORA 2025 (verified 2026-07-02):** AI acts as an *amplifier* — returns depend on the underlying sociotechnical system. For AI-agent-heavy delivery invest in golden paths, guardrails, observability, provenance, and review gates.

### §5.2 Error Budget Policy (DEFAULT)

| Budget State | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Normal (>50%) | Continue releases, routine monitoring |
| Accelerated burn (20–50%) | Heightened alerts, slow releases, reliability triage |
| **Exhausted (≤0%)** | **Feature freeze** — security/bugfix only; VP exception required |

Single incident consuming >20% → mandatory postmortem.
Two consecutive window misses → architecture review.

### §5.3 Incident Response (DEFAULT)

1. **Detect** → **Triage** (S1/S2/S3) → **Stabilize** → **Fix** → **Postmortem**
2. Roles: IC, Primary Responder, Comms Lead, Scribe
3. **Mitigation first, diagnosis second** during active incidents
4. All S1/S2 → mandatory blameless postmortem within 5 business days
5. Status updates: S1 every 15min, S2 every 30min

### §5.4 Runbook Template (HEURISTIC)

```markdown
## [Service] — [Symptom]
### Diagnosis
1. Logs: `kubectl logs -l app=<name> --tail=100`
2. Metrics: Grafana → [dashboard URL]
3. Dependencies: `curl -s http://<dep>/health | jq .`
### Emergency Mitigation
1. Rollback: `argocd app rollback <app>`
2. Traffic block: ...
### Root Fix
1. ...
### Escalation
- Owner: @team-sre
- PagerDuty: [policy]
```

### §5.5 Anti-Patterns

| Banned | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Infrastructure-only SLIs | User-experience-based SLIs |
| SLO without consequences | Error budget policy with freeze gate |
| Too many SLIs (>5 per service) | 2-4 meaningful SLIs |
| Page on every deviation | Burn-rate multi-window alerting |
| Blame individuals | Blameless postmortem, system improvement |
| No error budget policy | Define 3-stage policy (normal/accelerated/exhausted) |

---

## §6 Cross-References

| Topic | Canonical Owner | What dev-devops defers |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| Test strategy & CI test stages | `dev-testing` §5 | Test pyramid, coverage gates |
| Backend observability code patterns | `dev-backend` `observability.md` | OTel SDK setup, structured logging |
| Security hardening (app-layer) | `dev-security` | OWASP, auth, input validation |
| SBOM/signing depth | `dev-security` `references/supply-chain-sbom.md` | Supply-chain evidence policy beyond image scan gates |
| Architecture module boundaries | `dev-architecture` | Coupling taxonomy, barrel discipline |
| Scaffolding conventions | `dev-scaffolding` | File naming, project structure |
| Frontend build/bundle | `dev-frontend` | Vite/webpack config, SSR |

**dev-devops owns**: container builds, deploy pipelines, K8s manifests, IaC modules, SRE/incident response, edge infra, ML infra. DevOps owns operational scan execution and release gates; `dev-security` owns security policy, severity thresholds, and required evidence.
**dev-backend owns**: application-layer observability code, API design, health check implementation.
Overlap: observability alerting rules (dev-devops §5) ↔ observability code instrumentation (dev-backend `observability.md`). Cross-ref both.
