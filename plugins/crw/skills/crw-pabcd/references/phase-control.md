## Phase Control / Orchestrate

### Chat Surface

The chat command grammar is:

```text
orchestrate <I|P|A|B|C|D|status|reset> [--attest <json> | --attest-file <path>]
```

**On Windows use `--attest-file`.** PowerShell strips the quotes from inline JSON
and, once you escape them, splits the value at its first space — and every gated
edge needs a `did` narrative, which has spaces. Write the JSON first, then attest:

```powershell
'<json>' | Set-Content -Encoding utf8 .crw/attest.json
crw pabcd orchestrate A --session <id> --attest-file .crw/attest.json
```

Accepted prefixes include `$crw-pabcd`,
`crw pabcd orchestrate`, `/orchestrate`, and bare `orchestrate`.

### Semantics

- Chat-submitted commands are the human path.
- Human path can advance legal adjacent phases without attestation.
- Agent/terminal path is the live `crw pabcd orchestrate` CLI and is attest-gated:
  forward edges (P>A, A>B, B>C, C>D) require `--attest` evidence.
- `D` is a closing action that returns to `IDLE`; it is not a resting badge.
- `status` is read-only.
- `reset` is an explicit control action, not a normal phase edge.

### Per-phase artifact obligation (ORCH-ARTIFACT-01)

Advancing a phase is not the same as doing it (see [Faithful execution](../SKILL.md#work-phase-loop-multi-pass-tasks)). Each forward
edge must carry its real artifact, not just an `--attest` string: P = the actual diff-level plan;
A = an audit/review verdict that names blockers (`A>B` attest requires a non-empty
`auditOutput` — the pasted tail of the dispatched reviewer subagent's verdict — plus
the main agent's `auditVerdict` judgment, AUDIT-LOOP-01); B = the
implementation delta; C = fresh `tsc`/test/gate output (`C>D` attest requires a non-empty
`checkOutput` and `exitCode`, which must be `0`); D = a cycle summary with
evidence and the next-phase decision. A phase whose artifact is absent is not done, regardless
of adjacency.

**ATTEST-EVIDENCE-01 (DEFAULT):** write `did` with artifact pointers, not only a
sentence: plan/devlog paths, changed files, commands with exit codes, and evidence or
ledger paths when present. The runtime gate remains form-only for `did`; this is the
agent discipline that makes later audit possible.

**ATTEST-SHAPE-01 (STRICT):** every `--attest` object carries `from` and `to`
naming the edge it advances. The parser coerces before any gate runs
(`attest.ts` `coerceAttest`), so an attest without them is refused on EVERY
edge — including ungated entry edges — before `did`, `planUnit`, or
`workPhaseId` is ever examined.

| Edge | Required attest keys | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| IDLE->P | none — pass no `--attest` at all | If you pass one anyway it is still parsed, so it still needs `from`/`to` |
| I->P | none — unless overriding an unready interview, which needs `from`, `to`, `did`, `override` | |
| P->A | `from`, `to`, `did` with plan pointer, `planUnit` | `planUnit` must be a real `devlog/_plan/YYMMDD_slug/` holding numbered docs |
| A->B | `from`, `to`, `did`, `auditOutput`, `auditVerdict` (`pass`/`near-pass`/`fail`); near-pass adds `auditResidual`; a recorded `GO-WITH-FIXES (blockers=N)` adds `auditBlockers` | FAIL never advances |
| B->C | `from`, `to`, `did` with implementation delta | |
| C->D | `from`, `to`, `did`, `checkOutput`, `exitCode` (required, must be 0) | a goalplan-bound session also needs `testReceiptPath` from `crw pabcd receipt test` |

**Every gated edge additionally requires `workPhaseId` whenever a goalplan is
bound to the session** — it must equal the active work-phase (LOOP-UNIT-CHAIN-01).

Copy-paste objects. Replace the values; keep every key:

```json
{"from":"P","to":"A","did":"wrote the diff-level plan at <path>","planUnit":"devlog/_plan/260825_slug","workPhaseId":"wp1"}
{"from":"A","to":"B","did":"folded 1 blocker, rebutted 1","auditOutput":"<pasted reviewer verdict tail>","auditVerdict":"near-pass","auditResidual":"GO-WITH-FIXES (blockers=2); blocker 1 folded, blocker 2 rebutted because ...","auditBlockers":[{"blocker":1,"disposition":"folded","reason":"<how the plan changed>"},{"blocker":2,"disposition":"rebutted","reason":"<why it does not hold>"}],"workPhaseId":"wp1"}
{"from":"B","to":"C","did":"implemented <files>; <n> tests added","workPhaseId":"wp1"}
{"from":"C","to":"D","did":"verified at <sha>","checkOutput":"<pasted tail of the command>","exitCode":0,"testReceiptPath":".crw/evidence/<session>/test-receipt.json","workPhaseId":"wp1"}
```

Omit `workPhaseId` when no goalplan is bound, `testReceiptPath` when the
session is unbound, and `auditBlockers` when the recorded reviewer verdict has no `blockers=N`. Everything else is mandatory on that edge.

These are edge contracts, not substitutes for phase work. Artifact pointers must name
the evidence produced by the phase being advanced.

### Control surfaces (shipped)

Chat and CLI control the same persisted FSM and ledger; invocation source selects
the gate. A line-anchored chat `orchestrate <verb>` is a human free-pass, while
illegal edges remain refused. Agents use
`crw pabcd orchestrate <verb> --session <id> --attest <json>` (or `--attest-file <path>`,
required on Windows) and provide real evidence.
`A>B` requires `auditOutput` plus `auditVerdict`; near-pass also requires
`auditResidual`, and a round whose recorded reviewer verdict is `GO-WITH-FIXES (blockers=N)` also requires
`auditBlockers`: one `{"blocker":<n>,"disposition":"folded"|"rebutted","reason":"..."}` for each blocker 1..N.
`C>D` requires `checkOutput` and a passing `exitCode` — omitting it is refused, since a check with no outcome is not a check.
Mutating verbs require an explicit session; only `status` may use latest-session fallback.
**SESSION-IDENTITY-01 (STRICT):** use the current SessionStart binding, never a
parent or transcript-history id; this also governs `crw pabcd loop init` and `crw goalplan`.
When native CODEX_THREAD_ID is available, corroborate the binding using
`crw relay session current` before mutation. Missing, inherited or conflicting binding:
run `crw relay session current` then explicit `crw relay session bind` from the verified native
cwd. Never assign the environment ID, replay hook JSON or substitute `cli`.
The command verifies the native ID/cwd against Codex's read-only thread database,
rejects subagents and unavailable/incompatible identity, and preserves existing
state. A failed verification is not permission to guess. Binding reports
`hooksVerified:false`: it does not prove hook delivery, enable hooks or arm Stop.
SessionStart creates missing IDLE state without
clobbering resumed state; `cli` is terminal-only. Injected directives end with
`IPABCD: <phase> (<LABEL>)`. Injected footer values are prompt-time snapshots.
The final status reports the latest verified persisted phase and matching label
for the current SessionStart-bound session and cwd, including a later authorized
successful transition. This reporting rule requires no additional calls and grants
no transition authority. D closes to IDLE unless later authorized successful
re-entry occurs.

### Loop / goal activation handoff

Execution intent and HOTL activation belong to [crw-loop](../../crw-loop/SKILL.md).
This reference owns phase commands and attestations, not permission to execute.

### Source worktrees

A native session may keep its original cwd while implementing in a linked Git
worktree. From the native cwd, run `crw relay session source /absolute/worktree --json`
before entering B. It verifies native identity, pins the source worktree in the
same repository, and leaves session/goalplan/evidence storage in the native cwd.
`crw relay session current --json` reports `sourceCwd` and, for a bound worktree,
`sourceIdentity`. This is a source snapshot, not evidence that a check ran.

B entry/delta, `receipt test` execution and Check/final validation use that
worktree. Plans and receipt paths still resolve from the native cwd; use absolute
worktree paths for plan documents. The binding is immutable; repeating the same
command is idempotent. B entry pins the root in session state; if its binding file
is lost, the command can restore only that same pinned root, including during Check. A missing or changed binding cannot count as implementation.
A linked worktree is not exclusive to a session: edits by another actor in the
same worktree remain indistinguishable. Use a task-owned worktree.

For QA verdict `sourceSnapshotAt`, reviewer-lane `sourceIdentity` and final-gate
`sourceIdentity`, capture `session current --json` at observation time and retain
the entire identity, including `sourceRoot`. Do not copy an old snapshot or
reconstruct it from native HEAD. Test receipts capture automatically. Rootless
legacy receipts remain usable for unbound sessions only. Run
`crw pabcd loop validate --session <id> --slug <slug>` so validation uses the same binding.

An old, unbound B cycle cannot be rebound retroactively: its baseline describes the old
source. Preserve its evidence, stop any active goal using host-supported controls,
then use the supported return-to-I/replan path (I -> P with an explicit documented
readiness override when requirements are already known), bind before B, review the
plan and perform real new work before Check. Never fabricate a baseline or edit
native SQLite/FSM bytes to make the old cycle pass. An explicit reset also starts
a new cycle but is a separately authorized control operation.

If the pinned worktree was removed, recreate it at that path or start a new
native session for a different worktree. Reset does not retarget a source.
Binding publication requires filesystem hard-link support; unsupported filesystems
fail without replacing existing state or bindings.
