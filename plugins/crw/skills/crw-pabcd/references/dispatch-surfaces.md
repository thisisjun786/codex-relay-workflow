# Dispatch surfaces — thread or subagent

Read before choosing how to fan work out. This file owns the choice between
surfaces for unmanaged work; a CRW-managed lane is chosen first by
[DISPATCH-MANAGED-01](#dispatch-managed-01-strict--start-from-the-binding-not-from-the-mechanism).
[Delegation](delegation.md) owns what a subagent packet contains once
the choice is made, and its V1/V2 section owns the tool schemas.

## DISPATCH-MANAGED-01 (STRICT) — start from the binding, not from the mechanism

Before choosing a surface, find out what owns the work. Read the binding the task carries:
the task packet, the assignment record the relay holds for it, or the DAG node
([OPS-7.1](../../crw-run/references/operations.md#ops-71-what-an-assignment-binds) says what an assignment binds).

- **Managed** — a Linear issue the relay holds, or a DAG node. An independent lane for it is an
  independent relay child, started and resumed through `crw-run`: the managed start, the DAG release
  and their bridge recovery, pair/profile, capacity and receipt rules. It is never a desktop
  `create_thread` lane. The relay refuses a second active or paused assignment of the same issue and
  a release past capacity; those answers are followed, not routed around by creating a thread by
  hand. A project parent uses read-only and review helpers only; the implementation of an issue is
  its independent relay child's, and that child may own bounded native helpers for its own task.
  The manifest of managed lanes is a read-only projection of the relay assignments and DAG records,
  not a second file to keep. A goal-free parent is resumed by relay delivery
  ([OPS-8.1](../../crw-run/references/operations.md#ops-81-parent-continuation-and-waiting)): it
  checks the existing wake readiness ([OPS-8.5](../../crw-run/references/operations.md#ops-85-the-goal-free-parents-wake-path))
  and yields only after that readiness is established, never by arming a wake of its own.
- **Unmanaged** — standalone PABCD with no relay-held issue, and bounded helper delegation inside
  any task. The rest of this file applies as written.
- **Unknown** — the lookup failed, the relay is unavailable, or the identity is ambiguous. That is
  not permission to take the unmanaged route for an independent lane: resolve the binding, or
  report that it is unresolved and keep to bounded helpers meanwhile. Nothing is forced the other
  way either: a bounded helper or worktree worker needs no relay binding, and none is invented for it.

A native helper's dispatch record is a local helper record. It is never an independent child's
assignment, a DAG acceptance or a relay receipt.

## DISPATCH-SURFACE-01 (STRICT) — name the surface before dispatching

"파견", "dispatch", "delegate", "lane" and "agent" do not select a surface. Two
different mechanisms answer to those words and they are not substitutes:

- A **subagent** is a leaf spawned with the collab tools (`spawn_agent` in the
  `multi_agent_v1` or `collaboration` namespace). Its native cwd inherits the
  parent's working directory. It has no session state, no host goal and no PABCD FSM.
- A **thread** is a separate Codex task created with the desktop task tools
  (`create_thread` and its family). With `environment: worktree` it gets its own
  checkout; with `environment: local` it shares the project checkout. Either way
  it is an independent task with its own conversation, its own session binding and
  its own goal and PABCD state, because crw keys those to the task.

Isolation comes from the environment, not from being a task. A `local` thread is
an independent owner sharing one checkout; a `worktree` thread is an independent
owner with its own. An independent task lane needs the second.

An **independent task lane** owns a goal, PABCD cycle or long-running branch/CI
lifecycle: use one worktree thread per lane. A **bounded checkout worker** needs
only a disjoint checkout and returns a patch or evidence to the coordinator:
create a managed worktree, then give its absolute path to a subagent. The
subagent's native cwd still inherits the coordinator's; the packet must require
that path as the shell workdir on every command. Workers do not acquire their
own goal or PABCD state. Different workers must use different worktrees. The
worker's evidence is read in the tree the dispatch assigned to it, not in the
coordinator's native cwd; a dispatch that recorded no assigned tree keeps the
native cwd.

Say which one you are creating, in those words, before you create it.

## What actually differs

| | Subagent (`spawn_agent`) | Thread (`create_thread`) |
|---|---|---|
| Working directory | native cwd inherits the parent's; a bounded worker must pass its assigned managed-worktree path as the shell workdir on every command | its own, with `environment: worktree`; the shared project checkout with `local` |
| Git branch and HEAD | native cwd points at the parent's; commands run in an assigned managed worktree see that worktree's branch and HEAD | its own under `worktree`; shared under `local` |
| Edits visible to the parent | immediately in the selected checkout; a managed worktree has its own branch and files | only through git |
| Thread id | yes, its own | yes, its own |
| `.crw` session state | none | its own |
| Host goal | none; it must not call `create_goal` | its own, keyed to the task |
| PABCD FSM | none; it must not run `crw pabcd orchestrate` | its own, keyed to the task |
| Who owns the result | the parent integrates it | the task owns it, and the user owns the task |
| Visible in the app sidebar | no | yes |
| Creation authority | delegation authority | an explicit or clearly implied user request |
| Addressing | the returned handle | canonical `threadId` plus `hostId`; a creation still settling is not yet addressable |
| Waiting | `wait_agent` | `wait_threads` |

A distinct thread id is the trap. A subagent has one, which is why "thread" feels
like the right word for it. It proves nothing about the filesystem.

## DISPATCH-SHARED-TREE-01 (STRICT) — subagents inherit your cwd

A spawned child inherits the parent's cwd. Measured on 2026-09-13: a probe
subagent reported the parent's `pwd`, the parent's `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`,
the parent's branch and HEAD, and a file it created appeared as an untracked entry
in the parent's `git status`. In `codex-rs`, `apply_spawn_agent_runtime_overrides`
assigns the parent turn's cwd to the child config and is called from both spawn
paths; no worktree is created anywhere on that path.

Therefore:

- Write scopes across concurrent subagents must not overlap. A coordinator
  assigning separate managed worktrees must give each worker a different path.
- **Never** run concurrent branch-level git operations in one checkout.
  `checkout`, `switch`, `branch`, `stash`, `reset`, `rebase`, `merge` and `pull`
  change that checkout's HEAD or index; a per-file write scope does not separate
  them. Operations in different worktrees do not share one HEAD, but each branch
  still needs one owner and an explicit integration order.
- Tell the child its native cwd is your tree. It cannot infer this: on V1 the host tool
  description says the opposite, instructing the caller to have the child "edit
  files directly in its forked workspace". There is no forked workspace.
  `fork_context` and `fork_turns` fork conversation history, not the filesystem.
  Only the V2 usage hint states the shared directory, so a V1 session is never
  told it by the runtime.
- For a managed-worktree worker, instruct the subagent to pass the absolute
  worktree path as the shell tool's workdir on **every** command, including
  `git status`, tests and reads. Use absolute paths for file edits. Its native
  cwd and relative-path defaults do not move when the worktree is created.

## DISPATCH-ROUTE-01 (STRICT) — routing the work

Route by what the work needs to own, not by how parallel it is. A CRW-bound issue or DAG
node is routed by [DISPATCH-MANAGED-01](#dispatch-managed-01-strict--start-from-the-binding-not-from-the-mechanism)
first; this list is for the rest:

- Needs its own goal, PABCD cycle, user-visible task, or long-running
  merge/CI lifecycle -> **thread**, one per independent task lane, with
  `environment: worktree` for an isolated checkout. A `local` thread shares
  the checkout.
- Needs an isolated checkout for a bounded, coordinator-owned write packet
  while the coordinator is full-access -> call `create_worktree`, wait for its
  completed absolute workspace path, then spawn a **subagent** with that path
  and an instruction to pass it as the shell workdir on every command. Give
  concurrent workers disjoint worktrees and prohibit concurrent branch
  operations in one checkout. The coordinator owns goal/PABCD and integration.
- Is a bounded slice inside a thread lane that already owns its checkout ->
  **subagent** of that thread.
- Is a bounded slice of the checkout you are already editing, returning
  evidence or a patch -> **subagent** with disjoint file scope.
- Is read-only research -> **subagent**, by default. Read-only fan-out is not
  a template for parallel writes.

`create_thread` children may start with reduced approval permission, including
projectless targets. Confirm their actual permission state before planning an
unattended write lane. The bounded worktree/subagent route does not grant new
permissions; it uses the coordinator's inherited subagent permission and an
explicit checkout path. When a lane needs independent goal/PABCD ownership,
keep the thread route and handle its actual permission state.

## DISPATCH-AUTHORITY-01 — asking for lane work is asking for the lanes

Creating a thread is user-visible, so it needs a user request (a managed lane is started
by the relay, not created as a thread by hand). A request for
independent task lanes **is** that request: the lanes are the mechanism the work
needs, not a separate deliverable the user forgot to ask for. Bounded checkout
workers stay under the coordinator and follow DISPATCH-ROUTE-01. Do not read
the general "create a task only when the user explicitly asks" rule as a reason
to put independent task lanes onto the shared tree — that trades a visible
question for a silent collision.

Where the shape is genuinely unclear, ask once and name what you would create
("seven lane tasks, one worktree each"), then continue. Do not ask repeatedly and
do not treat silence as a refusal of the surface the work requires.

## Parallel lanes, and the shape that works

For unmanaged work, N independent task lanes mean N `worktree` threads, N checkouts and N FSMs.
The coordinator uses `wait_threads` and integrates; neither side advances the
other's FSM. N bounded checkout workers mean N managed worktrees and N
subagents, with one coordinator goal/FSM. The coordinator uses the returned
subagent handles and checks each worktree's files before integration.

### Record the lane before you need it (DISPATCH-LANE-ID-01, DEFAULT)

Thread creation can return a canonical id, or a provisional handle while the checkout is
still being set up. Record the canonical id and host the moment they exist, keep any
provisional handle in a separate field, and never pass a provisional handle to a tool
that wants a canonical id.

The trap is the inverse: a lane missing from a listing is not a lane that does not
exist. Listings are filtered and paginated, and a started thread is addressable from the
moment it starts. So if you already hold the canonical id, use it — do not make presence
in a listing a precondition for addressing a lane you created.

Addressing has one canonical form: `threadId` plus `hostId`. The user-facing mention the
app builds is `[@Title](thread://<threadId>?hostId=<encoded hostId>)`, and several lanes
can be referenced in one turn. A queued worktree instead returns a provisional
`clientThreadId` that no tool accepts; keep it in its own field.
[Lane dispatch](../../crw-loop/references/lane-dispatch.md) carries the packet contract and
the measured bounds.

Use the packet's three states to preserve this distinction: `dispatch` before requesting
creation, explicit `pending` after receiving only a provisional id, and `bound` once the
canonical address is confirmed. A pending packet carries `creation.provisionalId`,
`creation.hostId`, and `creation.requestedAt`, with optional nonempty `creation.worktree`;
it must have no `address` property. The timestamp is canonical UTC
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss[.sss]Z` with a real calendar date and exactly three fractional digits
when present. Dispatch rejects creation evidence and provisional address fields. Bound
may retain validated creation evidence but must not copy either recorded provisional id
into `address.threadId`.

Legacy packets with neither mode nor creation retain their address-based dispatch/bound
default. Creation evidence requires an explicit mode in the packet or CLI; conflicting or
malformed modes fail. `check-lane-packet.mjs` validates this record, including mixed-state
sets and their write-scope collisions. It does not provide a resolver, intercept native
calls, or retry creation. A pending record remains pending when the mapping is ambiguous;
title, cwd and elapsed time alone never justify promoting it to bound.

When the id really is lost, recovery is bounded and host-specific: identify the same
host, worktree and branch, then inspect candidate session metadata — matching cwd,
creation time, parent identity — and read the recorded session id rather than guessing
one from a filename. A shared cwd alone cannot separate a lane from its own subagents,
because a subagent runs in its parent's directory. Confirm a candidate through a
read-only task read before steering it, and leave ambiguity unresolved. Do not recreate
a lane because discovery failed; that is how one task becomes two writers.

### Arm the wake before you yield the turn (DISPATCH-WAKE-01, DEFAULT)

Lane work outlives a turn, and for unmanaged lanes nothing resumes a parent automatically.
Stop-continuation is bounded on purpose: it releases under context pressure and at the
stagnation cap. A parent that dispatches lanes, yields, and expects to wake up later has
arranged nothing, and every lane then sits finished and unmerged. In a managed run a
goal-free parent is resumed by relay delivery instead (DISPATCH-MANAGED-01): it verifies that
wake readiness and arranges no second wake or manifest.

Before yielding a turn with work still running, name the continuation owner and the
mechanism, verify the wake is actually active, and keep its identifier. With no wake
mechanism available, either keep handling the work inside the turn or report the
limitation — do not yield and hope. Deleting a wake removes the trigger and nothing else:
it does not complete the goal, and it is not permission to reinstate one later. Muting
notifications is not the same as stopping monitoring, and a scheduled run is not merge
authority.

### The observer shares the lanes' quota (DISPATCH-POLL-BUDGET-01, DEFAULT)

### Fan-out width is a lane property (DISPATCH-FANOUT-CAP-01, DEFAULT)

The intuition is usually backwards. Parallel *branches* are cheap to the host: no
host-wide cap on concurrently running tasks was found in the searched paths, and turns
queue per thread. Subagents are the capped resource — spawning past the session limit
fails outright with `agent thread limit reached`, at six per session by default
(`agents.max_threads`; on V2 `max_concurrent_threads_per_session` minus one for the
session itself).

Independent task fan-out belongs to thread lanes. Bounded checkout workers are
subagents even in separate worktrees, so they share the session's subagent cap.
Run them in waves, say the wave size, and close finished agents, because a
completed agent holds its slot until it is closed. "Unlimited parallel
subagents" is not a shape the host offers.

Lanes and the parent watching them usually draw on the same credentials and the same
API budget, so observation competes with the work it is observing. The parent owns that
aggregate: one coordination observer, deduplicated snapshots, one fetch per PR per
scheduled observation by default, and intervals of minutes rather than seconds for long
hosted jobs. Communication cadence is a separate decision from API cadence — telling the
user what is happening does not require asking the API again.

Before sustained polling, read the relevant budget (for example `gh api rate_limit`) and
reserve headroom for the workers. Back off on evidenced limit responses. Do not assume
every 403 is exhaustion, that every account has the same allowance, or that rate-limit
categories are interchangeable. This is guidance for the coordinator, not a limiter.

Threads and subagents compose in independent task lanes: each worktree thread
spawns bounded subagents inside its checkout. A full-access coordinator can
also assign separate managed worktrees directly to bounded subagents. In both
forms, different worktrees provide file and HEAD isolation; different thread
ids do not. Two `local` threads on one checkout still collide.

### The lane manifest (DISPATCH-LANE-MANIFEST-01, DEFAULT)

For unmanaged work, independent task lanes are separate tasks, so nothing in the system knows
two were handed the same issue until their pull requests collide. One shared record makes that
visible before the branches diverge. Managed lanes keep no such file: the relay refuses a
second active assignment of an issue, and their identity, checkout and status are read from
its assignment and DAG records. Per lane: repository, lane id, task and host id, worktree, branch,
base ref and sha, head sha, issue, owner, scope and status.
A bounded worktree worker remains under its coordinator and does not invent a
thread id or its own FSM. Record its worktree path and assigned scope in the
coordinator's packet or progress record instead.

```json
{
  "repository": "owner/repo",
  "lanes": [
    {
      "id": "lane-1", "taskId": "<threadId>", "hostId": "local",
      "worktree": "/path/to/worktree", "branch": "codex/one",
      "owner": "task:<threadId>", "scope": "validator",
      "base": { "ref": "dev", "sha": "abc1234" }, "head": "def5678",
      "issue": "owner/repo#184", "status": "running"
    }
  ]
}
```

Resolve `<crw-loop skill directory>` from the loaded loop skill path, then validate
it with `node "<crw-loop skill directory>/scripts/check-lane-manifest.mjs" <manifest.json>`.

Two rules the validator enforces because they are the ones people get wrong. An issue
reference must name its repository — a bare number is ambiguous the moment lanes span
repositories. And two ACTIVE lanes may share an issue only if each names a **different**
scope; silence means both believe they own all of it, which is precisely the collision
worth catching. A finished lane never blocks a new one.

**A manifest is evidence, not a lock.** It is a file. It cannot know whether a lane is
still running, whether a recorded head is current, or whether CI evidence is fresh, and
recording an owner authorizes nobody to rewrite that lane's branch or message its task.
A pass means the records are coherent, never that merging is safe.

### Merge handoff across tasks (DISPATCH-LANE-MERGE-01, DEFAULT)

The coordinating task decides sequencing; each lane executes only inside its own
checkout; no subagent ever manages another lane's branch. Before landing a lane:

1. Refresh the integration ref and re-read the manifest. A lane based on a stale ref is
   the usual source of a conflict that looks like a code disagreement.
2. Compare open PRs, worktrees and manifest entries for a duplicate issue, a duplicate
   branch, or overlapping scope. Resolve by giving one lane the issue or by partitioning
   it explicitly — not by merging and hoping.
3. Carry hosted evidence for the lane's PR: head sha, the sha actually tested, workflow
   event, run and check ids, attempt, conclusion, and required-shard coverage. Apply
   `crw-dev` §3 DEV-CI-EVIDENCE-01; a green summary is not the same as the expected jobs
   having run.
4. Land lanes serially. Shared surfaces — published counts, generated inventories, lock
   files — conflict in every lane at once, so parallel landing turns one rebase into N.

After a timeout or a compaction, recover from the manifest: reopen the recorded task and
worktree, refresh git and PR state, reconcile drift, and resume. A timeout alone never
authorizes replacing a lane and never proves one finished.

## What neither surface grants

A subagent may not create a goal, run `crw pabcd orchestrate`, or bind a session; the
parent owns all of it. A thread owns its own goal and FSM, and the parent may not
advance them — messaging a task is not commanding it. Neither surface inherits
permission the parent does not have.
