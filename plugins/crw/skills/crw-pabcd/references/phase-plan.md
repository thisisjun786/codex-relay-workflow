# Plan phase

## Architect consultation for formal P

Every formal P plan follows this sequence, including C2 compact plans and plan-only
P work; it is not limited to large or full plans. Applicability follows the planning
work, not whether the agent happened to write the required plan header. Explanation
or read-only assessment alone does not enter P. The dev-owned C0/C1 fast path needs
neither consultation nor a consultation record. Explicit user limits (such as no
delegation) take precedence; record any resulting consultation gap honestly.

1. Main gathers requirements and source evidence, identifies scope and existing owners.
2. Dispatch a read-only `architect` with `dev` and `dev-architecture` attached.
   Request a bounded design proposal: stable decision IDs for module responsibilities,
   data structures, interfaces and execution flow; source path:line evidence;
   alternatives and tradeoffs; unresolved assumptions.
3. Main records acceptance, rejection or amendment of each proposal and writes the
   executable plan: files, dependency order, changes and observable acceptance criteria.
   Architecture proposals inform these decisions; main owns the plan and final judgment.
4. Send that concrete plan to the SAME architect for a reflection check. Require
   `ALIGNED` or `MISALIGNED`, a decision-ID-to-plan mapping and exact gaps. Resolve
   material gaps with recorded main dispositions before independent A audit. A missing
   proposal or reflection check is not completed consultation. Keep the actual
   handle, proposal, main dispositions and reflection tied to the submitted plan
   revision in the [Plan output consultation record](plan-output.md#architect-consultation).
5. Dispatch the independent A reviewer. Architect reflection never replaces A.

Use the [delegation owner](delegation.md#architect-context-and-routing) for supported
transport, returned handles, one-plan context reuse and call failures. These are
agent-followed instructions (E7), not a new phase or hook-enforced consultation gate.

## Phase entry and executable plan

0. **I — Interview**: HITL-only requirements discovery; canonical rules live in `crw-interview`. PABCD owns I->P and return-to-Interview phase edges.
1. **P — Plan**: Explore first (read real code, configs, docs). **Slice and order phases by dependency/architecture structure (STRICT, PHASE-SPLIT-01)** — the orthodox unlimited-time build order: foundations (schema, contracts, core data flow) → core capabilities → integration → hardening/polish — so each phase consumes the verified output of the previous one. Effort-based bucketing is FORBIDDEN: never split or order phases by estimated effort or payoff speed — no "quick win vs heavy" buckets, no impact/effort matrices, no time-boxed slices. Phase boundaries encode the system's build order, not the schedule. DB/API/UI/test work inside a phase are subtasks, not top-level phases by default, and every phase must still close with something independently verifiable (build, tests, or a demonstrable surface). Write a diff-level plan: file change map, scope boundary (IN/OUT), and testable accept criteria. For every planned conditional path (error handler, fallback, guard, gated branch, threshold behavior), the accept criteria name its **activation scenario** — how C will trigger it and what observable effect proves it ran (C-ACTIVATION-GROUNDING-01). For C2+ plans, including plan-only requests, begin with the loop-spec header required by [Plan output](plan-output.md). For open-ended optimization, include the divergence plan, deterministic selection rule, and telemetry schema; if the verifier only reports scalar outcome, instrumentation is B's first work item before candidates. Ground every decision in code you have read. No implementation yet. For broad or unfamiliar repos, include a compact tree, detected conventions, which existing logs/docs you will reuse, and the SoT sync target (SOT-SYNC-01): which general source-of-truth doc (architecture/INDEX docs, or equivalent) this unit will patch in C — or, if the repo has none, the plan recommends creating one (dev-scaffolding §2.1). **A dependency-ordered phase map may be publishable as a PR stack where the repository's delivery path uses pull requests (`DEV-STACK-01`).** When the unit will produce dependent branches too large to review as one diff, P decides whether to stack and records it; CRW internal work is delivered as a task branch to the integrator and is not stacked. Rules: `crw-dev` `../../dev/references/stacked-prs.md`.

   **PLAN-VERIFIER-REAL-01 (DEFAULT).** Before writing a verifier command into the plan, RUN it. A command that does not exist (missing script/config) or does not read the change target is not a verifier. Next to each verifier record one line: its exit code, and whether it actually reads this unit's change target. Prove the "reads the target" claim with one of: the target path appears as a direct argument; a script/glob definition that includes it (quote the glob); a config `include`/`files` entry (quote it); or a call chain into a sub-script that reads it (cite file:line). If none of those hold, write "this command does not observe this change" and classify that acceptance row as human review — do NOT claim a gate protects it. Two common traps: a command that silently checks nothing when its config file is absent, and naming a gate as verifier for prose it never reads.

   **PLAN-FIELD-CHAIN-01 (DEFAULT).** A plan that adds a field to a type, or a value to an enum, must enumerate the value's WHOLE chain in the file-change map: creation (input type, builder, CLI arg) -> serialization -> deserialization (reviver, unknown-value handling) -> every consumer. When adding an enum value, search three things, not one: the type name, the field name, and every existing enum value — then also check non-comparison consumption: destructuring/aliases, `default` branches, generic predicates, and every function taking that type. Give each of the four stages a path or an explicit `N/A + reason`; a blank is indistinguishable from "did not check". A missed consumer makes the new value a ghost state counted by nothing; a missed creation path means the value can never be produced, so any condition depending on it never arms.

   **PLAN-BYPASS-NAMED-01 (DEFAULT).** A plan that adds enforcement must also record HOW to bypass it, in five fields: tier (E1-E8), executing surface (which hook/script/human), known bypass path, residual risk, and whether the wording was downgraded. A bypassable layer is called an "early warning", never "enforcement". `final layer: none` is an allowed answer — the point is to stop claiming enforcement that does not exist, not to manufacture an unbypassable layer. If you claim no bypass exists, give the evidence; that claim is usually wrong.
