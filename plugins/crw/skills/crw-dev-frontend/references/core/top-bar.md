# Top Bar Composition - Implementation Guide

Canonical owner for top-bar composition: geometry, slots, scroll-state
contract, spawned surfaces, and verification hooks. Material recipes live in
`liquid-glass.md`; do not duplicate opacity/blur recipes here. The top-bar
domain GATE lives in this file (FE-TOPBAR-DOMAIN-01 below); broader brand/
style judgment beyond that gate lives in `dev-uiux-design`.

---

## Domain Gate (FE-TOPBAR-DOMAIN-01, STRICT)

Liquid pill top bars are for expressive surfaces: landing, campaign,
editorial, portfolio, brand, and visual product pages.

Dashboards, admin, finance, government, B2B repeated-work tools, auth,
payment, security, and developer consoles keep standard solid headers by
default. Their chrome should be predictable, dense, and readable before it is
expressive.

## Geometry

Prefer a floating detached pill bar only when the first viewport can support it.
The bar must have a capped max-width, top inset, safe-area handling, and a
single outer capsule radius (`9999px` or >= 24px).

| Surface | Geometry | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Landing / campaign / portfolio | Floating detached pill | Legal when the hero has a calm bar zone and enough top breathing room. |
| Editorial / brand story | Floating pill or quiet full-width | Choose based on reading comfort and hero image complexity. |
| Consumer app shell | Full-width or compact solid header | Use pill only for promotional/home surfaces, not repeated workflows. |
| Dashboard / admin / finance / gov / B2B tool | Full-width solid header | Avoid detached liquid chrome; preserve scanning and task speed. |

STYLE_SAMPLE:

```css
.top-bar {
  position: sticky;
  top: max(12px, env(safe-area-inset-top));
  z-index: 40;
  width: min(calc(100% - 32px), 1120px);
  margin-inline: auto;
  border-radius: 9999px;
}
```

## Slots

Keep the bar sparse enough that the pill still reads as one piece of chrome:

- Logo: use the real brand SVG; see `brand-asset-sourcing.md`.
- Navigation: 2-5 links. More destinations move into a menu or full navigation
  surface.
- Controls: only include controls that earn their place in the first viewport
  (for example theme, language, account, or search when essential).
- CTA: one filled pill CTA is allowed. It must not create a row of competing
  primary actions.

Mobile collapses to logo + menu trigger. The menu opens a sheet or drawer with
a complete tap path; do not rely on hover behavior on touch devices.

### Segmented Multi-Pill Navigation

Within the expressive domains allowed by FE-TOPBAR-DOMAIN-01, segmented
multi-pill navigation is allowed only when each segment encodes a real IA group,
the aggregate choice count remains small, and mobile collapses the groups into
one coherent control. Augen, Cantor8, Vero, and Footer Design Gallery are the
evidence context. The result must still read as one piece of chrome: do not turn
every link into a separate capsule, and keep the single outer-capsule geometry
as the default outside this authored IA case.

## Scroll State (FE-TOPBAR-STATE-01, DEFAULT)

Top bars may be scroll-adaptive:

- At top: a lighter material state around 70-80% opacity is allowed only over a
  hero authored with a calm bar zone behind the chrome.
- Scrolled: use the near-opaque 85-95% opacity range and keep blur when the
  selected material state calls for it.
- Transition: animate `background-color` and `opacity` only. Do not morph size,
  width, radius, or layout on blurred bars.
- Accessibility supremacy: `FE-LIQUID-A11Y-01` in `liquid-glass.md` overrides
  every state here. Reduced-transparency, increased-contrast, unsupported
  `backdrop-filter`, or failed worst-case contrast collapses all states to
  solid or near-opaque.

STYLE_SAMPLE:

```css
.top-bar {
  transition: background-color 180ms ease, opacity 180ms ease;
}
```

## Hover Surfaces (FE-TOPBAR-HOVER-01, DEFAULT)

Any surface spawned from the bar is unconditionally near-opaque, blur-free, and
solid: dropdown, mega-menu, popover, account menu, language picker, or search
panel. Content must remain legible over the busiest background that can appear
behind it.

Hover surfaces also need a tap path. Mobile uses the same visual skin where
appropriate, but the interaction becomes a sheet, drawer, or proven picker
primitive with correct ARIA and keyboard behavior.

## Child Visuals

Nested pill visuals are governed by `FE-PILL-NEST-01` in `liquid-glass.md`.
Inside pill chrome, child controls render no capsule borders or outlines at
rest. Solid fills are not restricted by that rule; use hierarchy and accent
budget to decide how many strong fills the bar can carry.

Use fill or tint, not rest-state capsule borders, for `aria-current` and active
navigation state.

## Accessibility

The full bar and every spawned surface must be keyboard reachable:

- Tab order enters the logo, links, controls, CTA, and spawned surfaces in a
  predictable path.
- Escape closes spawned surfaces and returns focus to the trigger.
- Arrow-key behavior follows the underlying primitive pattern for menu,
  combobox, listbox, or picker.
- Sticky chrome never hides focused content; apply `scroll-margin-top` or
  equivalent offsets to in-page targets.
- Skip links remain visible and usable with the sticky bar present.

## Verification Hooks

Screenshot or otherwise inspect:

- At-top and scrolled states over their real hero/background.
- A bar-spawned hover surface over the busiest possible background.
- Reduced-transparency / increased-contrast collapse to solid or near-opaque.
- Mobile logo + menu trigger and the resulting sheet or drawer tap path.
