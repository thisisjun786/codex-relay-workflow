# Merge readiness

Use before integration, together with the target repository's policy and the
[shared authorization and review rules](../../crw-plan/references/integrations.md#default-dev-integration).
This procedure consumes existing CI and review evidence; it does not install a
reviewer, enable an unfinished app, or change branch protections.

## Identify the candidate and gates

Pin the repository, PR, destination branch, current base/head SHAs, and dependencies.
Read applicable repository instructions, effective branch rules/protections, root
CI workflows, and current review configuration. Separate required gates from
optional integrations. Use actual configuration and recent execution evidence;
old bot comments, a nested workflow file, or repository visibility alone do not
establish the active review setup. Lack of access leaves configuration unknown.

Record `isDraft` with the base and head. A pull request that is open for review has
entered review, which is not the same as being ready to merge: the gates below decide
that. A draft candidate is not merge-ready, and the fix is to publish it for review as
[Publish for review when the work is reviewable](../../crw-plan/references/integrations.md#publish-for-review-when-the-work-is-reviewable)
describes, not to merge around the gap. Findings or pending CI on an open pull request
never send it back to draft.

## Disabled reviewer policy

GitHub Codex automatic code review is disabled and is not a CRW completion or
merge gate. Do not trigger it, re-request it after a push, or wait for a fresh-head
Codex review or a settling period. Re-enabling it requires a new explicit user
decision; an old assignment, review comment, or pending check does not supply one.
Record it as disabled/not required, never as a successful review.

This applies to the external GitHub reviewer, not Codex execution tasks, their
model settings, CXC's workflow or independent review. Keep the target repository's
policy for other reviewers, required CI, parent verification, and sufficient
independent evidence. If an enforced GitHub rule still requires the disabled
reviewer, report the specific configuration conflict for authorized correction;
do not bypass the rule or silently change repository settings.

Existing findings remain subject to the triage below, regardless of their author.
A disabled reviewer does not excuse a confirmed defect or justify resolving its
threads without evidence. Refresh stale launch and recovery instructions on the
same parent and child tasks; preserve their work and dependency gates.

## Check CI for this candidate

Inspect both check runs and commit statuses, including their source identities,
revision coverage, and run/attempt URLs. Select the applicable latest attempt for
each gate; a later valid rerun may supersede an earlier cancelled or failed attempt.
Do not collapse distinct jobs or sources merely because their names match.

Required CI must satisfy the repository's gates for the candidate, including any
required merge-result/base compatibility checks. Pending, missing, failed, cancelled,
or inaccessible required evidence is unresolved. Accept skipped/neutral results
only when the repository's gate semantics make them legitimate for this change;
a green PR summary alone is insufficient. Resolve routine failures and recheck.

No configured CI is not a CI pass. Use the repository's permitted local validation
route if one exists and report that distinction. Do not invent a new hosted CI
requirement, waive an existing one, or claim readiness when necessary validation
is still unknown.

## Inspect review content and coverage

Collect relevant submitted reviews, inline threads, summary comments, statuses,
and independent local review artifacts. For each applicable source, establish who
reviewed what base/head or diff, whether the run completed, and which findings
remain. A successful review job can still contain defects; a completed COMMENTED
review can be useful evidence without being a formal approval. Thread resolution
alone does not prove a fix.

Where a count is the gate, read it to the end and prove that you did. An unresolved
count of zero is the value that OPENS the merge gate, so a truncated page reads as
a pass: sixty of sixty-three threads with nothing unresolved among the sixty once
reported "0 unresolved" about a candidate with three open threads and a P1 among
them. Every connection the verdict rests on - threads, reviews, comments, check
runs, workflow runs, jobs, statuses and the branch's own effective rules - carries
the same obligation, because a second required check on page two is exactly as
invisible as the sixty-first thread was, and a required gate declared by a ruleset
on a later page is missing from the very set that decides what "required" means.

`codex-session-relay merge-evidence --repository owner/name --pull-request N`
performs that reading and returns the record: it enumerates each connection until
its pagination is exhausted, counts unique identifiers against the reported total,
pins the head and base before collecting and re-reads them with the effective rules
afterwards, and reads a zero twice before reporting it. Exit 0 is the ready verdict
alone; a stale, unknown or not-ready answer exits 2 with the whole payload. A
truncated page, a permission error or a head that moved is reported as stale or
unknown and never as green or zero. Its `handoff` is the record a completion report
carries; the dispositions and the criterion evidence stay yours to judge, and it
never resolves a thread.

Three distinctions it makes that a reading by hand usually does not. A check is
identified by its workflow run and job name rather than by its name, so two runs
publishing one gate on a head are both binding and a run that REPLACED another -
a re-run, or a cancellation when new CI starts - does not block the run that
replaced it. A required context bound to an integration is answered only by that
integration, so a namesake from another app neither satisfies the gate nor blocks
it. And a submitted review whose state is CHANGES_REQUESTED refuses on its own,
while a summary comment is collected and never graded, because whether prose
describes a defect is a triage judgement and not an observation.

Keep completed, running, not run/disabled, unavailable/error, and stale evidence
distinct. A completion label without identifiable revision/scope does not prove
coverage. Reuse earlier review plus verified incremental review where it covers
the current change; refresh evidence invalidated by a new head, changed base, or
dependency. The implementation worker's own completion report is not independent
review. Obtain independent review appropriate to the change and repository policy.

Triage findings against code and acceptance criteria. Send confirmed in-scope
defects to the existing responsible task, verify corrections with focused checks,
and reconcile related threads within authorization. Record an evidence-backed
reason for duplicate, inapplicable, or disputed findings; do not dismiss them to
make the badge green. Material defects and unmet required review gates block merge.

For optional reviewers, observe a running review with bounded waits appropriate
to its expected runtime. If unavailable or stalled, use sufficient independent
review already available or obtain a permitted local review. Record the gap and
continue when the repository's requirements and relevant review coverage are met.
Do not wait for every historical or possible future reviewer. Fallback review
cannot replace required CI, a required review source, or mandatory formal approval.
Inspection does not authorize enabling integrations, new paid usage, or sending
private source to another service.

## Recheck, integrate, and record

Immediately before merging, reread the PR's base/head, relevant CI/review state,
and newly arrived findings. Reconcile changes since the review; refresh only the
proof they invalidate. A relevant unresolved finding still matters even if its
author is an optional reviewer. Use the repository's merge method and the host's
expected-head guard; preserve required base-update or merge-queue behavior.

`merge-evidence --restate <record>` is that re-read: it takes a fresh reading of its
own and grades the child's record against it, rather than reading the child's own
numbers back. A thread that arrived on the same head and is not in the record's
`threadsSeen` invalidates the record, which returns to the child that produced it.
The reading and the merge are not one act, and the command does not pretend they
are: the expected-head guard is what closes the gap at the moment of merging, and a
finding that lands after it is a late finding for the original issue's correction
path.

Serialize integrations sharing a target. Verify the actual landing and resulting
destination revision; an accepted or queued merge request is not a completed merge.
In the existing coordination record, retain the candidate and landed revisions,
CI attempt links/results, review sources and coverage, finding dispositions, and
any permitted fallback or remaining limitation. Keep implementation verification,
integration, and deployment as separate claims.
