# Dev Scaffolding

> **C0/C1 work (small local patches):** See `dev` §0.0 Work Classifier + §0.1 Patch Fast-Path before reading references.

> **`dev` is canonical:** `dev` §0.2 Rule Classes, §3 Verification Gate, and §5 Safety Rules apply to all work governed by this skill.

Rules for generating and auditing project structures. Create files directly following these rules.
Use the audit script (§12) for verification when it applies.
This skill activates by **change-surface**: new project setup, feature/module scaffolding,
structural audits, or documentation scaffolding.

## Modular References

| File | When to Read | What It Covers |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `references/implementation-log.md` | C2+/multi-phase/cross-session work units | Full devlog routine: decade-numbered plan folders, P-concretize → A-audit → D-archive loop, mainstream design-doc/RFC mapping |
| `references/api-docs.md` | API documentation generation | OpenAPI 3.1, developer portal, CI doc drift, SDK generation |
| `references/monorepo-tooling.md` | Setting up or optimizing monorepo builds | Turborepo vs Nx 2026 decision table, task graph for AI agents, CI optimization |

## External/current scaffolding evidence

For current generator behavior, template commands, package versions, framework
recommendations, provider bootstrap docs, or source-sensitive tooling choices,
read the active `search` skill and follow its query-rewrite, source-fetch, and
evidence-status rules. Browser fetch/open/text/get-dom/snapshot is used only
after candidate URLs exist and the setup claim needs source verification.

## 1. Structural Standard

Apply this pattern for new projects or when a repo has no clear structural convention of its own;
defer to an existing mature convention when one is present (§2). Three pillars:

1. **Screaming Architecture** — folder names reveal what the app does (`stock-price/`, `auth/`, `report/`)
2. **Colocation** — related files live together (logic + test + schema in the same folder)
3. **Public Boundary Export** — each feature/package exposes a single public entry point (`index.ts`, `index.js`, `__init__.py`, or Go package) at its boundary; internal convenience barrels are banned (owned by `dev-architecture` §5)

## 2. Existing Repo First

Before scaffolding inside an existing repo:
1. Resolve the repo root from `pwd` / project context / applicable `AGENTS.md`.
2. Detect existing architecture, docs, plans, changelog, ADR, agent-context, and source-of-truth conventions.
3. Read existing `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `devlog/`, `docs/`, `plans/`, `adr/`, `architecture/`, or equivalent source-of-truth docs before proposing new structure.
4. Reuse clear conventions instead of imposing the default pattern.
5. Show a compact tree before broad additions.
6. Do not create new project-level docs folders, planning folders, `AGENTS.md`, or extra tooling without approval.

MUST preserve mature repo conventions over the default scaffold pattern.

### CRW-First Durable Docs

**Rule (SCAF-SOT-01):** In crw or any repo that already uses durable devlog/source-of-truth conventions, prefer the existing `devlog/` placement, local numbering scheme, and source-of-truth paths before proposing generic `docs/` + `plans/`.

Keep it light:
- Cross-link scaffold docs to evidence paths (`path:line`, plan file, ADR, current-architecture note) so future workers can audit why files exist.
- Follow existing phase/decade numbering when present; do not flatten or renumber local history.
- In multi-cycle loop units, the decade docs (010, 020, 030...) are authored during
  the docs-only first work-phase (LOOP-DOCS-FIRST-01, `crw-loop`), not scaffolded
  empty.
- Treat source-of-truth placement as part of scaffolding completion: the final audit must say which durable convention was reused or that none existed.
- Boundary/public-export decisions still route to `dev-architecture` §1 (`ARCH-DECISION-01`, `ARCH-MAP-01`); scaffolding owns file placement and skeleton consistency.

## 2.1 Lightweight Source of Truth (implementation-unit devlog)

The implementation-unit devlog routine (`devlog/_plan/` units — `pabcd` §Work-Phase
Loop, UNIT-RESIDENCE-01) is the DEFAULT for C2+ work where the repository uses it.
C0/C1 follow the record exemptions in `dev` §0.1; do not create a unit just for them. Propose the `docs/`/`plans/`
architecture docs when:

C0/C1 record exemptions are owned by crw-dev §0.1; this routine does not override them.

- The repo is immature, undocumented, or inconsistent; or
- The user asks for a durable source-of-truth structure; or
- A broad change needs a durable plan/current-architecture record.

Default proposal:

```
docs/
  architecture.md        # current system shape, not future wishes
  conventions.md         # naming, layout, commands, testing
plans/
  active/                # active implementation plans
  done/                  # completed work summaries
```

Folder names are advisory. If the repo already has `devlog/`, `docs/`, `adr/`, `plans/`,
`changelog/`, `architecture/`, or another convention, propose using those instead.
Also detect optional lightweight source-of-truth files such as `CONTEXT.md`,
`CONTEXT-MAP.md`, and `docs/adr/`. Reuse them when present. Do not create them unless
the repo already uses that convention or the user approves. Create an ADR only for a
decision that is hard to reverse, surprising without context, or has a real tradeoff.

**SoT sync (DEFAULT, SOT-SYNC-01):** before patching a repo, FIND its general
source-of-truth docs first (architecture/INDEX docs, or equivalent)
and read them; any unit that changes architecture, contracts, or structure patches
the SoT doc in the SAME unit (C gate, `pabcd` C phase). If the repo has no SoT doc,
recommend creating one — once, via the proposal flow above — rather than silently
working without a source of truth.

Implementation-unit devlog method:
- Split large work into phase-level documents instead of one huge plan —
  dependency-ordered (PHASE-SPLIT-01), ALL written to diff-level up front
  (DIFFLEVEL-ROADMAP-01; both defined in `pabcd`).
- Keep diff-level plans in files, not chat: exact paths, NEW/MODIFY/DELETE, before/after diffs for MODIFY, complete content for NEW.
- Keep chat summaries short: explain the phase, show a compact tree/change map, then link the plan file.
- Move completed plan folders to an archive/done area if the repo already uses that convention.

Phase naming is owned by [Implementation units](../crw-pabcd/references/implementation-units.md)
(LEXICO-SPLIT-01). Use the existing three-digit convention; do not mix two-digit names.

Before creating any new source-of-truth folders, ask concisely: state that no durable docs were found,
show the proposed tree, give a specific recommendation, and confirm you will not create them without approval.
This gate governs introducing a convention, not routine unit subfolders in an
existing devlog/_plan. Create a unit only when required; crw-dev §0.1 does not
require a new unit for a C0/C1 fast-path record.

## 2.2 Project Skeleton

For a new project, propose the source-of-truth structure in the plan.
If the user explicitly asks for a full standard layout, create it.
Otherwise ask once before adding new project-level docs or plan folders.

When creating an approved new project skeleton, include the source-of-truth and feature-based essentials:
`AGENTS.md` + `README.md` (context/overview when requested or already used by the repo),
`.env.example` + `.gitignore`, `src/` with a `shared/` for truly shared code,
`config/`, `docs/`, and `tests/e2e/` when they fit the stack. Then add the
language-appropriate package manifest, entry point, language config, and per-feature
public boundary exports (per `dev-architecture` §5; file names from language detection, §3).
Defer exact layout to the framework's own generator when one exists.

## 3. Language Detection

Detect project type from existing files. Priority order:

| File Found                             | Project Type                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `tsconfig.json`                        | TypeScript (Node)             |
| `package.json` (no tsconfig)           | JavaScript (Node)             |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | Python                        |
| `go.mod`                               | Go                            |
| `Cargo.toml`                           | Rust                          |
| None of the above                      | → Tech Stack Decision (below) |

For greenfield projects, use the Tech Stack Decision process (§3.1) instead of asking “What language?”

## 3.1 Tech Stack Decision (New Projects)

When creating a new project with no existing framework, guide the user through plain-language choices:

1. **Type**: What are they building? (static site, interactive app, full-stack service, CLI tool, data pipeline)
2. **Scale**: How big? (1-3 pages, multi-page, ongoing content, large app)
3. **Features**: Login needed? Data storage? Real-time?

Present options as `<Framework> — <what it gives you>`, recommend one with reasoning, let the user pick.

Match tool complexity to task complexity. Escalate tooling only when justified by user requirements (SEO, CMS, scaling).
If the task is ambiguous or cross-cutting, route through the `pabcd` skill flow before scaffolding.

## 4. Fullstack Split Rule

Decide project layout based on runtime:

| Scenario           | Layout                   | Example                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Single runtime     | `src/` modular           | Next.js, Node CLI + API, Python monolith |
| Multiple runtimes  | `frontend/` + `backend/` | React + FastAPI, Vue + Go API            |
| Monorepo (3+ apps) | `packages/` or `apps/`   | Turborepo, Nx                            |

Each side gets its own package manifest and entry point. Shared types go in root `shared/` or `packages/shared/`.

## 5. Feature Module Rules

When adding a new feature, create a folder under `src/` with these files:

| Language   | Folder        | Main File      | Test File      | Public boundary export |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| JavaScript | `kebab-case/` | `name.tool.js` | `name.test.js` | `index.js`             |
| TypeScript | `kebab-case/` | `name.tool.ts` | `name.test.ts` | `index.ts`             |
| Python     | `package_name/` | `name_tool.py` | `test_name.py` | `__init__.py`          |
| Go         | `kebab-case/` | `name.go`      | `name_test.go` | *(package = boundary)* |
| Rust       | `kebab-case/` | `name.rs`      | inline `#[cfg(test)]` or `tests/` | `lib.rs`/parent `mod name;` |

The `index.*` file is the feature's **public boundary export**. Barrel discipline is owned
by `dev-architecture` §5: external consumers import this boundary, internal code imports
sources directly, and convenience-only internal barrels are banned.

Principle: “flat until you can't” — start flat, add a sub-folder only when a folder becomes hard to scan.

## 6. Naming Conventions

| Item                | Rule                  | Example                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Repository folders | Follow existing convention; kebab-case is a JS/TS sample | `stock-price/` |
| Importable packages | Follow language identifiers; no hyphens in normal Python imports | `stockprice/`, `stock_price/` |
| JS/TS files         | kebab-case + suffix   | `stock-price.tool.ts`        |
| Python files        | snake_case + suffix   | `stock_price_tool.py`        |
| Go files            | snake_case            | `stock_price.go`             |
| Rust files          | snake_case            | `stock_price.rs`             |
| Plan folders        | `YYMMDD_slug/`        | `260510_feature_bootstrap/`  |
| Phase docs          | decade-prefixed `NNN_slug.md`, `000_*` is the index (LEXICO-SPLIT-01) | `000_plan.md`, `010_phase1_build.md` |
| Functions (JS/TS)   | camelCase             | `getStockPrice()`            |
| Functions (Python)  | snake_case            | `get_stock_price()`          |
| Functions (Go)      | PascalCase (exported) | `GetStockPrice()`            |
| Functions (Rust)    | snake_case            | `get_stock_price()`          |

## 7. File Suffixes

| Suffix                                             | Role                    | Languages    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| `.tool.ts` / `.tool.js` / `_tool.py`               | Core business logic     | JS/TS/Python |
| `.test.ts` / `.test.js` / `test_*.py` / `_test.go` | Tests                   | All          |
| `.schema.ts` / `.schema.js`                        | Type/schema definitions | JS/TS        |
| `.route.ts` / `.route.js`                          | API routes              | JS/TS        |
| `.template.md`                                     | Templates               | All          |

## 8. Function-Structure Docs

Structured per-feature docs are part of the **full** scaffolding standard, not the lightweight default.

Use them when:
- The user explicitly asks for full structural docs.
- The repo already maintains per-feature structure/function docs.
- A broad feature needs durable module-level function documentation.

When used:
- One `.md` file per feature folder (e.g. `price.md`, `auth.md`)
- Keep each document concise, bounded, and task-oriented — not padded to a fixed length
- Required sections: File Tree, Module Responsibility, Key Function Signatures, Dependencies, Dependents, Sync Checklist
- Update the corresponding `.md` whenever a feature is added or modified
- Template: `<SKILL_DIR>/assets/str_func_template.md`

Do not generate heavy feature docs by default for small or immature repos.
Prefer lightweight architecture/conventions docs first.

## 9. Split Rules

Split smells (heuristics, not hard gates):

| Condition                       | Action                                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| File grows past >400 lines      | Split into focused modules within same folder |
| Folder becomes hard to scan     | Create sub-folders by responsibility          |
| Different runtime needed        | Split into `frontend/` + `backend/`           |
| 3+ apps share code              | Extract to `shared/` or monorepo `packages/`  |

## 10. Cross-Cutting Scaffolding

This section owns scaffold file placement only. Behavior, policy, and verification come from the owning surface skill (`dev-backend`, `dev-frontend`, `dev-devops`, `dev-security`).

### Health Endpoints
Backend scaffolds should propose health routes (skip if the mature repo already handles health checks per §2):
- `src/routes/health.ts` (or equivalent) — `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (readiness)
- See `dev-backend/references/core/health-checks.md` for response format

### SEO Boilerplate (Web Projects)
Web project templates should include:
- `public/robots.txt` with AI crawler allowlist
- Meta tag component with OG defaults
- JSON-LD helper utility
- Sitemap generation (static or dynamic)

### CI Template
Generate CI config scaffold:
```
lint → typecheck → test (unit) → test (integration) → build → deploy (staging)
```

### Security Boilerplate
Generate security scaffolding: CSP headers, CORS config, rate limiting middleware, `.env.example` with placeholder secrets. See `dev-security/SKILL.md` for full patterns.

---

## 11. Documentation Generation

When generating project documentation or scaffolding docs:

### README Generation
1. Read existing structure (§2 Existing Repo First)
2. Generate README with: project purpose, quick start, architecture overview (link to existing source-of-truth docs if present), contribution guide
3. Match tone to project maturity: immature repos get setup-heavy READMEs; mature repos get architecture-heavy ones

### API Documentation
1. Scan route files and extract endpoint signatures
2. Generate per-endpoint docs: method, path, params, request/response shape, auth requirements
3. Place alongside code (colocation) or in `docs/api/` per project convention

### Structure Documentation
1. Generate or update the repo's existing structure docs
2. Include: directory tree, module responsibility map, dependency flow
3. Follow the repo's existing source-of-truth convention when one exists

### Planning Documentation
1. Follow decade numbering (../pabcd/references/implementation-units.md, LEXICO-SPLIT-01): 000-009 research, 010-019 phase 1, etc.
2. Each plan entry should capture: title, date, what changed, why, evidence paths
3. Cross-reference related plan entries within the same work folder when helpful

---

## 12. Audit

Run the scaffold audit if one is available for the repo (e.g. `bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/scaffold-audit.sh [project-path]`) to check structural compliance. Audit checks should reflect the project's own conventions — covering feature-based structure, colocation, public boundary exports (dev-architecture §5), optional source-of-truth docs, `.env` safety, file length, and `AGENTS.md` where those apply.

## Scaffold Contract (SCAFFOLD-CONTRACT-01, DEFAULT)

Source: sol research (microsoft/apm, HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard).

A scaffold operation must be deterministic and verifiable:

1. **Manifest**: before generating files, produce a list of files that will be
   created/modified with their purpose. Show it to the user or record it.
2. **Idempotency**: running the scaffold twice on the same input should not
   create duplicates or corrupt existing files.
3. **Template provenance**: record which template or pattern was used and its
   version/commit so the scaffold can be reproduced.
4. **Dry run**: for C3+ scaffolds, offer a dry-run mode that shows what would
   be created without writing files.

## Post-Scaffold Verification (SCAFFOLD-VERIFY-01, DEFAULT)

Apply the following only to a runnable project scaffold and only for supported commands.
Documentation scaffolds use link/structure/contract checks; module scaffolds use affected
checks. Do not install dependencies, start servers, or run a broad suite merely to validate prose.
For a runnable scaffold, verify usability within the authorized environment:

1. `npm install` / `pip install` / equivalent dependency installation succeeds
2. `npm run build` / `cargo build` / equivalent build succeeds
3. `npm test` / `pytest` / equivalent test suite passes (even if only a smoke test)
4. Linter runs clean (or with only pre-existing warnings)
5. Dev server starts and responds (for web projects)
6. A second scaffold run on the same input does not break the first (idempotency)

Failures in any of these steps mean the scaffold is incomplete. Fix before
claiming done.
