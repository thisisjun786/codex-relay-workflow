# Native Desktop Acceptance — Tauri, AppKit/SwiftUI, WidgetKit, Menu-bar Apps

Last reviewed: 2026-09-24
Applies to: Tauri apps, AppKit/SwiftUI code linked into another host (Swift static library + C ABI), WidgetKit extensions, menu-bar/tray apps, native window materials, embedded runtimes and sidecars, macOS desktop release paths
When to read: A change touches one of those surfaces, or you are asked for a desktop regression audit or release readiness
Canonical owner: dev-devops native desktop acceptance
Non-goals: building a desktop app for the user; iOS/Android (→ `dev-frontend/references/stacks/mobile-native.md`); approval prompts in depth (→ `macos-system-approvals.md`)

## §1 Scope and triggers (DESKTOP-SCOPE-01)

A desktop app is several products in one bundle: a UI, a host runtime, embedded
executables, extensions, and a signed, distributed artifact. Source review,
host-only CI and a screenshot each cover one of them. Name which one before
claiming anything.

- A Swift, Rust or web change that alters a **presented native surface** (panel,
  popover, window, material, tray menu) triggers UI rows.
- A non-UI change (a Swift model, a Rust command, a sidecar flag) triggers
  runtime and packaging rows only. Do not demand screenshots for code nobody sees.
- A signing, entitlement, bundle-layout, architecture or updater change triggers
  packaging and distribution rows even when no code changed.

When a goalplan tracks this work, register each criterion on a session-bound
plan with `crw pabcd loop add-criterion --session <id> --criterion <text> --surface
desktop [--presented native]` (`init` refuses `--surface`). Use `--presented
native` only when the criterion needs inspection of a presented native surface.
It activates a soft, fail-open C-phase Stop advisory requesting an explicit
native observation; it does not block completion. Without a recorded final gate,
the desktop classification still calls for this matrix. A schemaVersion 2+
plan with a recorded final gate requires a QA receipt, and each non-native
desktop criterion needs a matching artifact-identity entry in that receipt.
Default v1 plans rely on QA ingress validation. Hosts editing plans need a
build that preserves `desktop` and `presented` on read and write.

## §2 Acceptance matrix (DESKTOP-MATRIX-01)

One row per boundary, never one "desktop OK" row.

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| Row id | Stable id, e.g. `D-UI-03` |
| Boundary | What joins what: popup ↔ status item, Rust ↔ Swift ABI, app ↔ sidecar |
| Scenario | The exact situation exercised |
| Verdict class | UI, runtime, packaging or distribution |
| Required level | The weakest evidence level that can prove this row (ladder below) |
| Achieved level | The level the evidence actually reached |
| State | pass, fail, not_verified, needs_human, hosted_required, na |
| Artifact id | Which artifact the evidence came from (§6) |
| Baseline class | §5 |

Evidence levels, weakest to strongest: source review → host-only build → signed
bundle inspection → bundled runtime launch → native interaction → publication.
A row can pass only when the achieved level is at least the required level.

Mapping to crw-qa: each row is one crw-qa scenario whose scenario id is the row
id; `note` carries the state, required and achieved levels. UI rows are `gui`
verdicts with `captureChecks`. Runtime, packaging and distribution rows are
`cli` verdicts, except a distribution row observed as a dialog (Gatekeeper),
which is `gui`. `not_verified`, `needs_human` and `hosted_required` roll up as
QA `FAIL` with the blocker named, because crw-qa has no skip. `na` maps to
`NA` and needs the recorded structural reason crw-qa requires. Evidence from a
hosted runner enters the scenario directory as the downloaded job log or
artifact, with the run id, attempt and head SHA recorded (crw-dev
DEV-CI-EVIDENCE-01). The hosted head SHA must equal the verdict's
`sourceSnapshotAt.commitSha` on a clean tree; otherwise the row stays
`not_verified`, because nothing else checks that the run built this tree.

Example rows for a change to a Tauri tray popup rendered by a native panel:

| Row | Boundary and scenario | Class | Required | Achieved | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-UI-01 | Popup opened over another app's window, dark appearance | UI | native interaction | native interaction | pass |
| D-UI-02 | Popup content longer than the panel: scroll bounded, footer visible | UI | native interaction | source review | not_verified |
| D-RT-01 | Bundled CLI runs from the signed app with final entitlements | runtime | bundled runtime launch | bundled runtime launch | pass |
| D-PK-01 | `lipo -archs` on app executable and sidecar equals `x86_64 arm64` | packaging | signed bundle inspection | host-only build | not_verified |
| D-DS-01 | `xcrun stapler validate` on the notarized DMG | distribution | signed bundle inspection | — | hosted_required |
| D-DS-02 | First launch of the downloaded DMG app shows the expected Gatekeeper dialog | distribution | native interaction | — | needs_human |

## §3 Downstream rows (DESKTOP-DOWNSTREAM-01)

A failure at one level leaves every row that depends on it `not_verified`: a
build that fails before bundling cannot say anything about launch, notarization
or installation. After a repair, review every assertion the repair newly makes
reachable. A removed upstream failure often exposes an assertion that was never
executed, such as a hardcoded executable path that the bundle does not declare.

## §4 Ordinary CI versus the release path (DESKTOP-CI-MAP-01)

Before claiming a regression audit or release readiness, tabulate what ordinary
CI builds against what the release workflow ships:

| Dimension | Ordinary CI | Release path |
|---|---|---|
| Architectures | often host-only | universal or per-arch set |
| Toolchains | Bun/Rust/Xcode/SDK/deployment target as pinned in CI | as used by release |
| Sidecar preparation | may be skipped | target-triple names, universal merge |
| Signing | ad-hoc, no secrets | Developer ID, entitlements, timestamp |
| Nested bundles | may be absent | `.appex`, frameworks, helpers |
| Distribution | usually none | DMG, updater archive and signature |
| Final artifact execution | rarely | launch and bundled CLI execution |
| Install/upgrade | never | coexistence with an existing install |

Every row where the columns differ is coverage ordinary CI does not provide.
Run the supported non-publishing release-equivalent job (dry run) early rather
than discovering each difference in turn. Never give signing secrets to
untrusted pull-request code.

## §5 Baseline classification (DESKTOP-BASELINE-01)

Classify each row as unchanged, regressed, new, removed or repair-introduced,
against a real baseline oracle: an earlier artifact you actually ran, not a
memory of one. If the baseline version has no desktop surface at all, write
"baseline absent" and treat the rows as new-feature obligations. "No desktop
regressions" is not a finding when there was no desktop to regress.

## §6 Artifact identity (DESKTOP-ARTIFACT-01)

When a desktop row depends on a built artifact, set `desktopArtifact: true` in
its `verdict.json`, list its goalplan IDs in `criterionIds` (for example
`["c-3"]`), and include exactly one `artifact-identity.json` in `artifactRefs`.
The identity file uses `version: 1` and these fields:

- Required `bundlePath` (the `.app` path) and `bundleExecutable` (the
  `CFBundleExecutable` value); optional non-empty `bundleIdentifier`. The
  executable component path must derive from
  `<bundlePath>/Contents/MacOS/<bundleExecutable>`. The validator checks path
  consistency; it does not read `Info.plist` to verify that value.
- `components` contains exactly one record each for `app`, `executable`,
  `archive`, `dmg`, and `updater`, plus any `sidecar` and `extension` records.
  Each has a unique non-empty `id` and a `kind`. An applicable `app` has a path
  to a `.app` directory containing `Contents/Info.plist` and a lowercase
  `sha256` bundle tree digest. Compute it with
  `node plugins/crw/skills/qa/scripts/validate-evidence.mjs --bundle-digest <path.app>`.
  The tree digest covers file bytes, paths, directories and symlink targets;
  bundle symlinks must resolve inside the bundle. Applicable executable and
  archive records carry file SHA-256 digests; every other applicable file
  component also carries a lowercase SHA-256 digest. Applicable executable,
  sidecar and extension records additionally carry non-empty `architectures`.
  An unavailable component uses `{ "applicable": false, "reason": "..." }`
  and needs no path, digest or architectures. An applicable app requires an
  applicable executable and archive.
- `signing.mode` is `ad-hoc` or `Developer ID`. A Developer ID identity needs
  non-empty `signing.teamId`; ad-hoc requires it absent or null.
  `signing.entitlements` is a normalized object of boolean, string, finite
  number or string-array values. Record values from the signature inspection.
- `toolchain.xcodeSelectPath`, `toolchain.sdk` and
  `toolchain.swiftcVersion` are required non-empty strings; `rustVersion` and
  `bunVersion` are optional when those tools were used. `coveredRowIds` must
  include the verdict's desktop scenario ID.

`validate-evidence.mjs --emit-receipt` validates referenced identities and
hashes each verdict and identity file into typed QA receipt `artifactManifest`
entries (`path`, `sha256`, `kind`, optional `criterionIds`). It copies the
validated verdict's IDs to its identity entry; receipt parsing rechecks bytes
and that binding. A schemaVersion 2+ recorded final gate requires a matching
identity entry for every non-native desktop criterion. Default v1 plans use QA
ingress validation only. A `presented: "native"` criterion uses the soft native
observation advisory and has no artifact-manifest requirement from this gate.
An ad-hoc single-architecture `.app` does not satisfy a universal Developer
ID, DMG or updater row. The archive hash binds its bytes but the validator
does not unpack it to prove the app is inside.

## §7 Tauri, Rust and Swift boundary (DESKTOP-FFI-01)

When Swift UI code is compiled into a static library and linked into the Tauri
executable:

- Swift `@_cdecl` exports match the Rust `extern "C"` declarations. Check with
  `nm` on the archive and on the final executable.
- The archive the build script emitted is the one that was linked. A SwiftPM or
  Xcode build of the same sources proves nothing about the Cargo-linked app.
- Status-item and panel calls stay on the AppKit main thread (engineering
  practice).
- Borrowed pointers are copied before the call returns; callbacks are torn down
  with the panel.
- Minimum OS values agree between the `swiftc -target` triple and
  `Package.swift`, or the difference is a recorded decision.
- Glass materials (`NSGlassEffectView`) versus the fallback view depend on the
  build toolchain and the runtime OS. A symbol check proves the code path
  exists, not that the material is visible or clipped correctly.

## §8 WidgetKit (DESKTOP-WIDGET-01)

Widgets live in their own extension and update through timelines. In practice
the extension has its own build product, compile mode, entry point, placement
under `Contents/PlugIns` and signature (the OpenCodex case in crw issue
#232). Widget success says nothing about the menu-bar panel, and the reverse.

## §9 Sidecars and universal binaries (DESKTOP-UNIVERSAL-01)

- Tauri `bundle.externalBin` needs a file with a `-<target-triple>` suffix for
  every supported architecture. A universal build also needs a universal
  sidecar under the name the bundler looks for (in the #232 case,
  `ocx-universal-apple-darwin`); confirm the expected name from the failing or
  succeeding bundler run, not from memory.
- Each embedded executable reports exactly the expected architectures.
- The bundled CLI runs from the **final signed bundle** with its final
  entitlements. JIT runtimes under Hardened Runtime need
  `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`, or they may fall back or crash.
- Use the shipped behavioral oracle:
  `node plugins/crw/skills/dev-devops/scripts/verify-lipo-command.mjs --artifact <file> --arch <a> --arch <b> --candidate-json '<argv-json>'`.
  It compares the reported architecture set exactly (`arm64` and `arm64e`
  differ), runs the candidate argv against the good artifact, creates a thin
  negative control and requires the candidate to fail on it. The candidate
  JSON must contain one `{artifact}` placeholder. No shell string is evaluated.
  Record the lipo executable/toolchain identity and fixture with the result.
  This proves only that candidate's behavior on that toolchain and fixture;
  it does not prove packaging, signing, notarization or native interaction.
  Multi-architecture `-verify_arch` forms observed on this Mac failed with
  `requires exactly one input file`, so do not prescribe them.

## §10 Menu-bar and popup scenarios (DESKTOP-POPUP-01)

Capture the native panel itself. A browser or web-dashboard screenshot cannot
satisfy a native panel row. The status item is customized through its
`button`; record where the panel appeared relative to it on each display.

| Scenario | Why it breaks |
|---|---|
| Plain desktop behind the popup, and another window behind it | Materials and corner clipping render differently over content |
| Light and dark appearance | Material and text contrast |
| Long content | Scrolling must stay bounded and the footer visible |
| Focus, Escape, click outside, reopen | Panels that do not dismiss or reopen cleanly |
| Several displays and the notch | Placement relative to the status item |
| Full-screen Space, auto-hidden menu bar | Panel never appears or appears off-screen |

Scenarios that need a person, or a prompt only a person may answer, are
`needs_human` rows with exact instructions (`macos-system-approvals.md` §6).

## §11 Signing, notarization and distribution (DESKTOP-DIST-01)

- Notarization needs a Developer ID certificate, Hardened Runtime, a secure
  timestamp and no `get-task-allow` entitlement.
- Entitlements attach to executables. Shared libraries, frameworks and
  in-process plug-ins inherit the host's; app extensions, widgets included, are
  separate executables with their own signature and entitlements. Check each
  with `codesign -d --entitlements -`.
- `codesign -vvv --deep --strict` checks nested code at notarization
  strictness. Changing any file in a bundle after signing invalidates it.
- `spctl --assess -vv` and `xcrun stapler validate` on the distributed
  artifact (engineering practice).
- Tauri updater signatures cannot be disabled; `createUpdaterArtifacts` produces
  the `.app.tar.gz` and `.sig`; `pubkey` must be the key content, not a path.
- Notarized is not launch-tested. Apple notes that some software fails to run
  after notarization because Gatekeeper enforces checks a relaxed notarization
  did not, and advises testing before distribution.

## §12 When local execution is not allowed (DESKTOP-NOLOCAL-01)

If the user forbids local runs, keep every row and mark it `hosted_required`
(a hosted macOS runner or an authorized native session can execute it) or
`not_verified`. A person's acceptance covers only the scenario they state.
Source-string tests and reviewer attestations never replace executing the tool.

## §13 Report shape

Report UI, runtime, packaging and distribution verdicts separately, each with
its rows, evidence levels and artifact ids, and list every row that is not
`pass` with its blocker.
