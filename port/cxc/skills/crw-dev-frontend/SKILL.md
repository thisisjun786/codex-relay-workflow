# Dev-Frontend — Domain-Correct Frontend Engineering

Build production-grade frontend implementations from an established product/design direction.
This skill owns HTML/CSS/component/runtime implementation, responsive behavior, accessibility
wiring, visual verification, and frontend platform rules.

> **Role separation:** For design judgment — typography/color/layout direction, UX decision
> gates, product personalities, or vague visual briefs — load `dev-uiux-design` first. This
> skill implements the chosen direction; `dev-uiux-design` makes the design decisions.
> Implementation anti-slop tell detection and enforcement stays here (concrete rendered tells
> in UI); design-level concept/taste judgment lives in `dev-uiux-design`.

> **Role boundary (canonical — identical in `dev` and `dev-uiux-design`):**
> `dev` owns universal process, evidence, and safety rules. `dev-uiux-design` owns
> design intent, direction, and concept judgment. `dev-frontend` owns concrete frontend
> implementation and rendered tell enforcement. Anti-slop has three layers: `dev` =
> output/process hygiene (FAMILY-SLOP-01), `dev-uiux-design` = concept/taste judgment
> (is this direction generic or domain-wrong?), `dev-frontend` = rendered implementation
> tell detection and removal (FE-AI-TELL-01).

> **C0/C1 work (small local patches):** See `dev` §0.0 Work Classifier + §0.1 Patch Fast-Path before reading references.

Start with `anti-slop.md`, `aesthetics.md`, `responsive-viewport.md`, and `visual-verification.md`. Add domain/locale/stack references only when relevant.
For C2 ordinary app screens (form/table/list/detail), `crud-ui.md` alone suffices; add the style references above for marketing/visual surfaces or C3+ work.

- UI/rendering bug RCA: load `dev-debugging`.
- Build pipeline, bundle config, or deployment: load `dev-devops`.
- Project setup or file placement conventions: load `dev-scaffolding`.
- Data-driven dashboards, reporting views, or data format expectations: load `dev-data`.

When frontend choices depend on current framework, design-system, browser API, library
behavior, or package/source freshness, follow `dev` §External Evidence and Recall Routing
and load the `search` skill for current/external lookups.

### Verification grounding

**STRICT:** For render/executable artifacts (HTML, SVG, games, UI, charts),
run the real renderer: headless browser, screenshot, canvas check, or equivalent.
Observe the actual output yourself, fix what observation reveals, then re-run.
Static parsing confirms well-formed files; it does not prove the artifact is
visually or interactively correct. One clean observation is enough for unchanged
state; do not re-render unchanged output just to repeat evidence.

---

## 0. Frontend Routing

Before designing or coding, classify the work:

| Decision | Options | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product surface | landing, app, dashboard, AI tool, public service, education, game, creative | Sets density, typography scale, asset requirements |
| Locale | Korean-first, global/i18n, English-only | Sets CJK typography, copy, date/number formats |
| Density | campaign, consumer app, productivity, SaaS, ops, finance, developer console | Prevents landing-page composition inside repeated-work tools |
| Asset need | none, screenshot, product photo, diagram, chart, illustration, soft 3D, game asset | Prevents asset-free gradient/card UI |
| Soft 3D/character gate | not allowed, subtle, primary | Prevents generic cute 3D/mascot slop |
| Motion intensity | static, feedback-only, expressive, cinematic | Prevents cinematic motion in utility workflows |

Default rules:
- For apps/tools/dashboards, build the actual working surface first, not a marketing hero.
- For Korean-first work, read `korea-2026.md` and `ux-writing-ko.md`.
- For any soft 3D miniature, mascot, chibi, toy-like object, or character-like asset, read `soft-3d-asset-gates.md`.
- For product/brand/object/place/person pages, use concrete visual assets in the first viewport.
- For finance, government, B2B, admin, auth, security, and developer tools, keep visual warmth restrained and subordinate to clarity.
- Every user-facing decision point must justify its existence — defaults first, one primary action per screen, choices demoted to progressive disclosure (`crw-dev-uiux-design` UX-LAZY-01 owns the gate).
- For text-heavy surfaces (landing, marketing, editorial, public service), apply typography wrapping defaults — see `typography-wrapping.md`. Dashboard table cells are excluded.

---

## 1. Component Identification

When the user describes UI in vague terms (e.g. "접히는 거", "팝업 같은 거"):
1. Recommend the best-fit component with reasoning: `<Name> — <what it does, why it fits>`
2. Confirm, then proceed

If the user already names a specific component, skip this step.
Reference: [component.gallery/components](https://component.gallery/components/)

For new React/Vue/Svelte/Next UI source files, prefer `.tsx` or typed component files when the repo supports TypeScript. Inherit `dev` TypeScript strict-compatibility rules.
If frontend structure is unclear, read existing source-of-truth docs first, then document pages, components, routes, state stores, and build commands in the repo's existing docs before broad implementation.

---

## 1.5 Objective Gates vs Style Samples

Two different kinds of rules live in this skill (see `dev` §0.2):
- **Objective UX gates (STRICT/DEFAULT)** — accessibility baseline (§7, §11), state coverage
  (loading/empty/error/permission), keyboard operability, visible focus, contrast. Missing
  these are review findings.
- **Style direction (STYLE_SAMPLE)** — design direction intake (§2), aesthetics, density profiles,
  product personalities, preset tokens, and the concrete values in §4-§5 (palettes, font
  choices, pixel max-widths). These illustrate acceptable choices; they are NOT
  requirements, must not override an existing design system (Design System Detection stays
  MANDATORY), and must never be enforced as universal taste (UX-STYLE-01).
## 2. Design Direction Intake

> When the user cannot articulate a clear design direction, load `dev-uiux-design` first —
> it owns intent discovery and direction selection. This section validates and implements
> the chosen direction; it does not choose independently.

Before coding, validate the design direction from `dev-uiux-design` (or a concrete brief):
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Surface**: Is this a working tool, dashboard, public service, AI workflow, game, landing page, or editorial surface?
- **Tone**: Confirm the direction. For product tools this often means quiet, dense, trustworthy, and fast rather than loud.
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance budget, accessibility requirements.
- **Signature**: What ONE visual signature will make this unforgettable? (the signature
  moment; supporting scroll reveals may exist alongside it per
  `motion.md` FE-MOTION-BUCKET-01)

When user intent is vague ("깔끔하게", "모던하게", "just make it look good"), read the `dev-uiux-design` skill and run the User Intent Discovery Protocol before making routing decisions.
If the user cannot answer these questions, use the `dev-uiux-design` skill's structured preference elicitation flow. Offer product references ("Notion 느낌? Linear 느낌?") and visual comparisons.

**Concept pass before code (pointer — canonical: `dev-uiux-design` §2.5 UX-CONCEPT-GEN-01):**
for C2+ expressive or brand-visible surfaces, load `dev-uiux-design` §2.5 before
implementation. It owns direction discovery, concept branching (open direction: 5
distinct isms → lock one → refine; concrete direction: 3-5 contextual variants),
synthesis, and direction lock. Resume here after `DESIGN.md` is locked.

Intentionality over intensity. Bold maximalism, refined minimalism, dense utility, and friendly consumer UI can all work when they match the domain.

---

## 3. Baseline Configuration

Adjust these dials based on what's being built. Present to user if unclear.

| Dial             | Default | Range | Meaning                              |
| ---------------- | :-----: | :---: | ------------------------------------ |
| DESIGN_VARIANCE  |    5    | 1-10  | 1=symmetric utility, 10=asymmetric art |
| MOTION_INTENSITY |    4    | 1-10  | 1=static, 10=cinematic choreography    |
| VISUAL_DENSITY   |    5    | 1-10  | 1=art gallery airy, 10=cockpit dense   |

After Design Read, set dials per `dev-uiux-design` §2 Dial Setting.

Product density profile (D1-D8 in `references/core/product-density.md`) sets component class; VISUAL_DENSITY (1-10) sets spacing within that class. These are orthogonal axes.

Adapt dynamically based on user requests. Dashboard → density up. Portfolio → variance up. Data tool → motion down.
Korean app/tool surfaces usually need higher density and clearer hierarchy, not oversized hero text.

---

## 4. Implementation

Read `references/core/aesthetics.md` for full guidelines. Summary:

- **Typography**: Use domain-appropriate typography. For Korean-first UIs, prioritize CJK-safe stacks before Latin display fonts. Apply `text-wrap: balance` on all headings **AND short descriptors** (hero subtitle, card description, caption — anything 1-3 lines). Use `text-wrap: pretty` only on body paragraphs (4+ lines). `pretty` has no effect on short text and will leave Korean orphans like "합니다." or "화." on a line alone. See `typography-wrapping.md` for full rules.
- **Color**: Max 1 accent. Use neutral bases (Zinc/Slate) with singular high-contrast accent — avoid purple-on-white. One-note means the ENTIRE page is dominated by variations of a single hue family. One accent color with neutral bases is correct, not one-note.
- **Layout**: Match the product surface. Avoid centered-card/hero patterns in repeated-use tools.
- **Motion**: See `references/core/motion.md`. One signature moment + a few
  supporting reveals > 10 scattered effects; landing-bucket floor/ceiling per
  FE-MOTION-BUCKET-01.
- **Assets**: Use screenshots, product images, diagrams, charts, illustrations, generated bitmaps, or soft 3D only when they add product meaning. Never ship a placeholder. Prefer real/generated image or video assets over CSS gradient washes. Read any design reference or captured screenshot back into context with `view_image` before matching it. Third-party captures follow `reference-capture.md` (analysis-only, provenance manifest).

  1. **Probe**: `ima2 status` → `ima2 serve` if down → recheck.
  2. **Generate**: `ima2 gen` with explicit long prompts; `--ref` for style anchors.
  3. **Inspect**: `view_image` every candidate.
  4. **Synthesize**: element ledger per FE-ASSET-SELECT-01.
  5. **Iterate**: `ima2 edit` for targeted fixes.
  6. **Verify**: browser screenshot of rendered result.

  Fallback: `$imagegen` only when ima2 is truly unavailable.

  `ima2` supports multi-candidate generation (`-n N`, multimode, and independent CLI
  parallel; FE-ASSET-PARALLEL-01), prompt builder, session style sheets, and provider
  routing (GPT/Grok/Gemini; FE-ASSET-PROVIDER-01). Monitor parallel jobs with
  `ima2 ps --json` and cancel unwanted jobs with `ima2 cancel <id>`. For motion assets,
  use `ima2 video` under FE-MOTION-VIDEO-01. Prompts must specify subject, composition,
  palette, lighting, style, and aspect per `asset-requirements.md`.

  Concept mockups guide implementation and are not shipped; production assets require candidate inspection and selection; cutout assets additionally follow FE-ASSET-BG-01.
- **Visual verification**: exercise the changed flow using the available capability selected by `dev/references/browser-routing.md` and `dev-testing` §4.7. Read rendered output and verify the interaction; no single optional browser is mandatory.

### Icon Implementation (FE-ICON-01, DEFAULT)

- **Library route:** install `@phosphor-icons/react` by default. Use
  `iconoir-react`, `@untitledui/icons`, `@hugeicons/react`, or `lucide-react` only when
  the Design Read selects Iconoir, Untitled UI, Hugeicons, or Lucide respectively;
  confirm the exact package and license before installation.
- **Custom route:** generate the approved icon artwork with `ima2 icon`, trace it with
  `vtracer`, optimize the SVG with `svgo`, then convert it with `svgr` when a React
  component is required. Preserve an editable source asset and inspect both the SVG
  and rendered component before shipping.
- **Layer consistency:** use one library per icon layer. Do not mix Phosphor navigation
  with Lucide content icons; a separate custom/premium domain layer is allowed only
  when it is deliberately art-directed as a layer.
- **Weight semantics:** `regular` is the default state, `fill` indicates selected or
  active state, and `duotone` is reserved for empty states or illustrative emphasis.
  Keep size, optical weight, color behavior, and accessible labels consistent.

### Cutout Asset Generation (FE-ASSET-BG-01 surface — STRICT)
Every cutout asset MUST follow `references/core/asset-requirements.md` § Asset Background Strategy; load it with `ima2 skill front ref asset-requirements` when ima2 is available.
---

## 5. Anti-Slop Enforcement

Rule classes (dev §0.2): items below are DEFAULT — deviate with a stated reason; concrete
values and palettes are STYLE_SAMPLE (§1.5); the emoji-as-UI-icon ban is the only STRICT item.

Read `references/core/anti-slop.md` for full rules. Key standards:

Award examples do not establish universal taste rules. Use the shipped design-trends
reference and reopen its sources; explain the product-specific role and preserve
accessibility. No private goalplan is required to justify a design decision.

### Hero discipline (FE-HERO-01)

- First viewport must fit: hero content leaves a hint of the next section on mobile and desktop.
- Keep hero copy to ~4 text elements max: headline, subhead, primary CTA, one proof/context line.
- Do not put trust strips, pricing teasers, feature bullets, or mini dashboards inside the hero.
- Logo walls belong below the hero, not as hero filler.
- Plan font scale with image/product scale so neither crushes the other.

Before delivery, run the second-order reflex test (FE-REFLEX-TEST-01, `anti-slop.md`) against both the obvious category default and its fashionable opposite.
Audit composite convergence tells under FE-CONVERGENCE-01 (`anti-slop.md`): hairline border+shadow, icon-tile-above-heading, italic-serif-hero, hero-metric template, and other multi-element compositions.

- Treat unexamined default typography as a slop signal. Choose a domain-appropriate stack; Korean-first UI should use CJK-safe fonts and system fallbacks deliberately.
- **Gradient budget (FE-GRADIENT-01)**: gradient soup is the 2026 #1 anti-slop signal; max 1 ambient gradient per viewport and no gradients on 3+ sibling cards — see `anti-slop.md § Gradient Budget`
- **One-note theme ban (FE-ONENOTE-01)**: full-page single-hue dark washes (terminal green, cyber cyan, CRT amber) are the current dark-mode tell — see `anti-slop.md § One-Note Theme Ban`
- **No self-describing meta copy (FE-METACOPY-01)**: UI text must explain the product/user job, never narrate the mockup, layout, responsive behavior, or agent process — see `anti-slop.md § Self-Describing Meta Copy`
- Use neutral or intentional color palettes — purple gradients on white are now the old tell; gradient overuse and one-note single-hue themes are the current tell
- Use asymmetric or purposeful layouts — centered-everything reads as template
- Vary card sizes, spans, and groupings — equal 3-card grids read as generic
- **Bento composition (FE-BENTO-01)**: bento grids must read as one interlocking slab with aligned row edges, a dominant cell, content-weighted spans, and no orphan tail — see `layout-discipline.md § Bento Composition`
- Avoid oversized bold hero text inside tools, dashboards, admin, finance flows, and public services
- **Hero composition (FE-HERO-SPLIT-01)**: never build a split hero (left bold headline + right boxed screenshot/mockup card) unless the user explicitly requests one — the product visual is the stage (full-width, background, or interactive demo), never a right-column card; paid-conversion LPs are the one context to propose it — see `layout-discipline.md § Hero Composition Grammar`
- Avoid asset-free UI: abstract blobs/gradients do not replace real visual evidence
- Avoid generic soft 3D icon packs; soft 3D must be semantic, brand-consistent, and restrained
- **NEVER use emoji as UI visual elements** (feature icons, card icons, section markers, buttons) — emoji in production UI is the #1 AI slop signal. Use SVG icons (Lucide/Phosphor/Heroicons), but choose the set from the Design Read instead of treating that parenthetical as a default. Lucide-as-default is itself a 2025-2026 vibe-coded tell: detect icon-library monoculture when the project uses the same glyphs and weight as every shadcn starter. Prefer a domain-correct library and a deliberate domain/brand layer; do not swap libraries randomly for novelty. See `anti-slop.md § Emoji Slop`
- Warm beige/cream backgrounds with brass/clay accents are banned as defaults for premium-consumer briefs — see `anti-slop.md § Premium-Consumer Palette Ban`
- Layout monotony (same family repeated, 3+ zigzag sections, overused eyebrows) — see `references/core/layout-discipline.md`
- Color, shape, and theme must be locked per-page and audited before shipping — see `references/core/consistency-locks.md`
- Use off-black (`#0a0a0a`, `#111`) — pure `#000000` lacks depth
- **Responsive enforcement (DEFAULT)**: every multi-column section must declare its mobile/tablet collapse behavior — "it'll work at mobile" is not a plan. See `responsive-viewport.md`
- **Page containment required**: `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or equivalent wrapper. Content stretching to viewport edges on wide monitors is a layout bug
- **Mobile is a different product**: section composition, CTA placement, and interaction model change on mobile — it is NOT just "desktop stacked vertically." See `mobile-ux.md`
- Use realistic, specific names and brands in placeholder content
- Write original copy — avoid "Elevate", "Seamless", "Next-Gen" and similar clichés
- Treat uncontrolled heading line breaks (orphaned single word, no `text-wrap`, no `max-width` in `ch`) as a slop signal — see `typography-wrapping.md`
- Treat short descriptors (hero subtitle, card description, caption) using `text-wrap: pretty` instead of `balance` as a slop signal — `pretty` does nothing on 1-3 line text, especially Korean
- Treat Korean orphan fragments ("합니다.", "화.", "입니다." alone on a line) as a slop signal — always verify Korean text breaks at target viewports
- Treat generic stroke icons as brand logo substitutes as a slop signal — use actual brand SVGs from Simple Icons, SVGL, or press kits. See `brand-asset-sourcing.md`
- When NO design brief exists, do not invent a generic default: apply the domain-gated no-brief kit owned by `dev-uiux-design` §1 UX-DEFAULT-ISM-01 and state the assumption

### Do not ship these tells (FE-AI-TELL-01)
Enforce the complete AI-default tell catalogs in `references/core/anti-slop.md` and `references/core/layout-discipline.md`.

## 6. Performance Guardrails
Animate only `transform` and `opacity`; isolate perpetual animation, remove temporary `will-change`, reserve z-index for systemic layers.
Keep grain/noise filters off scrolling containers. Centralize polling/subscriptions; clean up SSE/WebSocket on unmount.
Never open unbounded per-component connections; prefer one multiplexed connection.
For detailed budgets and browser connection limits, read `references/core/performance-budget.md`.

## 7. Accessibility Baseline

- Semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text)
- Visible focus indicators (`focus-visible:ring-2`)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Skip link or equivalent bypass for repeated navigation
- Focus must not be hidden by sticky headers, sticky bottom bars, sheets, or overlays
- Icon-only buttons need accessible names (`aria-label`, visible text, or labelled-by)
- Charts, status messages, loading progress, and AI streaming states need screen-reader labels or live regions where appropriate
- Do not encode meaning by color alone
- Modals, menus, comboboxes, bottom sheets, and command palettes must have a complete keyboard path
- Stress-test Korean long labels and screen-reader names; clipped Hangul is a failure
- Pointer targets follow WCAG 2.2 AA target-size rules; 44×44px is a conservative product baseline, not the only legal minimum

### A11y polish (FE-A11Y-POLISH-01)

- CTA text fits on one line at target breakpoints; if it wraps, shorten the label or change the layout.
- Inputs need visible boundaries against their background in default, focus, error, and disabled states.
- Duplicate CTA intent on the same screen should merge or clearly differ by outcome.
- Button contrast is checked during visual review, not left to palette intent.

## 8. React, Forms, and Accessibility
For React hooks, state ownership, performance, and Compiler, read `references/stacks/react.md`.
Custom hooks: only for reusable behavior with explicit inputs, small outputs, honest dependencies, justified effects, correct cleanup. Do not hide server/router/form ownership inside generic hooks.
For forms: follow repo stack and schema-validation conventions; expose field errors accessibly with `role="alert"`.
For widget keyboard paths, focus trapping, ARIA state, and screen-reader testing, enforce `references/core/a11y-patterns.md`.
The objective accessibility baseline in §7 remains mandatory.
---

## 12. Frontend Platform Rules
Prefer project conventions; detect installed framework/version before changing configuration.
Read `references/stacks/react.md` for React 19.2+ features, Compiler, Suspense, Effects, state.
Read `references/stacks/nextjs.md` for Next.js 16 App Router, caching, Server Actions, RSC.
Prefer native CSS (container queries, `:has()`, nesting, subgrid, View Transitions, `dvh/svh/lvh`) before JS observers.
Do not introduce Webpack-era config unless the existing app is Webpack-bound.
Never cache user/session data without an explicit user-scoped key.
Classify state using the table below before adding a store, Effect, or cache.
### State Classification
Before adding state, classify it:
| State type | Owner | Default tool |
|---|---|---|
| render-local UI | nearest component | `useState` / `useReducer` |
| derived | render calculation | expression / `useMemo` if expensive |
| form draft | form boundary | native form, React Hook Form, TanStack Form |
| server/cache | server/cache layer | RSC, Next cache, TanStack Query, SWR |
| URL/navigation | router | path params, search params |
| global client UI | external store | Zustand, Jotai, context |
| optimistic mutation | mutation boundary | `useOptimistic`, mutation library |
| AI stream | conversation boundary | append-only message model + stream status |

Rules: Do not store derived state just to sync with Effect. Do not put server state in Zustand. Do not put URL-shareable state only in component state. Keep optimistic state reversible.

Before creating tokens, run Design System Detection (MANDATORY): check `package.json` for installed systems, existing tokens/themes, and the brief.
**Aesthetic honesty (FE-AESTHETIC-HONESTY-01):** aesthetic directions are not official design systems.
For shadcn/ui, inspect local components and follow `components.json`, aliases, tokens, and registry.
AI-native interfaces must represent real states; never fake streaming, citations, or tool calls.

## 13. Error Boundaries

React Error Boundary pattern:
- Wrap each major section (not the entire app) in an Error Boundary
- Error boundary renders: friendly message + retry button + report link
- Log error to monitoring service (Sentry, etc.) in componentDidCatch
- Never show stack traces to end users

Error state hierarchy:
1. Field-level: inline validation message
2. Form-level: summary at top of form
3. Section-level: Error Boundary with retry
4. Page-level: `error.tsx` / error page
5. App-level: root Error Boundary → offline/crash page

## 15. Backend Contract & Security Alignment

Frontend does not operate in isolation. When consuming backend APIs or implementing security-sensitive UI:

### 15.1 Contract Ownership

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---------------|-------|
| Response envelope shape (`success`, `data`, `error`, `meta`) | `dev-backend` defines, `dev-testing` verifies |
| Consumer-side fixture alignment | **Frontend** — keep mocks in sync with `fixtures/contracts/` |
| Contract test triggers | Frontend payload changes → update contract tests BEFORE merging (see `dev-testing` §3) |
| Error display mapping | Frontend maps `error.code` to user-facing messages; never parse `error.message` for logic |

**When a frontend change touches API consumption:**
1. Check if the response shape assumption still holds
2. If changed, update or add a contract test first (see `dev-testing` §3.5)
3. Align frontend mocks/fixtures with backend golden examples

### 15.2 Security Responsibilities

| Control | Policy Owner | Implementation Owner |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| CSP directives | `dev-security` §5 | Frontend (no inline scripts, no `eval`, no surprise 3rd-party scripts) |
| CORS | `dev-security` §5 | Backend middleware (`dev-backend` §4) |
| XSS prevention | `dev-security` §5 | Frontend (avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; if needed, sanitize with DOMPurify + CSP defense) |
| Token storage | `dev-security` §2 | Frontend (`httpOnly` cookies preferred over `localStorage`) |
| Auth state display | `dev-security` §2 | Frontend (loading → check → redirect or render; never flash protected content) |

### 15.3 Testing Integration

- Playwright smoke tests validate rendered flows AFTER backend API + contract tests pass
- Frontend unit tests mock API responses using the **same envelope shape** defined in `dev-backend` §5
- When backend error codes change, frontend error-mapping tests must be updated

## §16 Pre-Flight Checklist

Before shipping a production frontend surface, run through the full pre-flight checklist
at `references/core/preflight-full.md`. It covers design/composition, responsive/mobile,
states/behavior, Korean-first rules, SEO/theme/i18n, and performance/verification gates.
Use it as the C-phase audit companion for frontend work at C2+.
