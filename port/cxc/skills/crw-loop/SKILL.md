# crw-loop — Scoped completion

## Intent before activation

Apply the current request's authority before choosing a mode:

- An explanation, review, or quoted mention of crw-loop is not an execution request.
  Do not create a goal, mutate the FSM, or start implementation merely to explain it.
- Explicit interview-only, plan-only, read-only, no-writes, no-commits, no-goal,
  no-FSM, no-tests, and no-delegation limits take precedence when actually stated.
  Do only the authorized work. A plan-only
  request is not permission for A/B/C/D; an interview is not permission to leave I.
- An operative bare crw-loop request means HOTL completion of all plans within the
  agreed objective. An explicit HITL request instead preserves human P/A/B pauses.
  Ordinary development requests do not become HOTL because this skill was loaded.
- HOTL changes persistence, not permissions. It does not authorize unrelated work,
  push, merge, release, deployment, installation, destructive actions, or new access.
  If missing intent or authority prevents progress, report it; do not silently
  enlarge the scope. Do not enter Interview while a host goal is active.

A **leaf** — a spawned subagent — never opens a host goal, runs `crw pabcd orchestrate`, or
spawns; it follows its packet and reports. A dispatched **task** is not a leaf: it owns
its own goal and PABCD state, and it runs a loop when its packet grants the objective,
the criteria and the completion condition. Absent that grant it does the stated work and
reports rather than inventing a goal. Neither the coordinator nor a lane advances the
other's FSM. See [Lane dispatch](references/lane-dispatch.md) for the packet and the
measured host envelope. Follow the live host tool contracts, including goal creation and
blocked-status conditions. A plugin hook accepting a call is not proof that the call is
authorized.

Keep this goal's work local; do not send unsolicited progress or completion notices
to other tasks. Peer contact is limited to explicit user requests or necessary confirmed
blocking CI/merge collision coordination, subject to host permissions and wake
checks. An incoming peer question is not a new loop request or permission to resume an old
goal. Follow [peer collaboration](../dev/references/peer-collaboration.md) for
question-only wakes and independent task authority; apply this loop only to work
the user actually authorized.

For useful mid-work questions, follow [Async user questions](../dev/references/async-questions.md)
when the tool is exposed and the host permits it. Leave optional questions without
expecting replies, keep working and incorporate answers if they arrive. An unanswered
optional question does not block completion. Interview retains its existing goal
restrictions; async is not a workaround for a denied question or missing approval.

## Select the smallest sufficient reading path

The agent selects owners from the task, work class, risk, and current phase.
Read each selected SKILL.md completely; then read only references whose conditions
apply. Resolve relative links from this skill's directory, not the working directory.
Keep read batches within the active tool's output limits.
If output is truncated, recover the missing content before the governed
action; command exit0 is not a complete read. Reuse content still present in context; after context
loss reload the applicable owner, not the whole skill family.
If a selected file's output is truncated, re-read that file separately. Do not
guess missing ranges from an elision marker. If it cannot fit one result, use
numbered, contiguous, non-overlapping chunks through EOF and verify no gaps.
Do not recursively load every linked file. A missing mandatory reference is a
preflight failure: resolve it or report the limitation before the governed action.

| Condition | Read before the governed action |
|---|---|
| Development or governed review | [crw-dev](../dev/SKILL.md), then its matching surface routers |
| Tool composition, response projection, or in-context JS computation | [Native execution](../dev/references/native-execution.md); prefer exposed Code Mode, not a forced runtime |
| Real PABCD work or a PABCD plan | [crw-pabcd](../pabcd/SKILL.md), then only the current phase references it selects |
| Start/resume HOTL or diagnose its continuation/completion | [Runtime lifecycle](references/runtime-lifecycle.md) |
| Create, register, amend, or inspect durable goalplan schema/CLI | [Durable goalplan](references/durable-goalplan.md) |
| Two or more work-phases, including scope discovered later | [Implementation units](../pabcd/references/implementation-units.md) |
| Repeated failure, reviewer FAIL, or unclear loop archetype | [Loop engineering](../pabcd/references/loop-engineering.md) |
| Score optimization, plateau, or mechanism comparison | [Optimization rules](../pabcd/references/optimization.md) and loop engineering |
| Deliberate divergence/candidate comparison | [Divergence tiers](references/divergence-tiers.md) |
| Choosing between a thread and a subagent, or planning parallel lanes | [Dispatch surfaces](../pabcd/references/dispatch-surfaces.md) |
| Dispatching tasks that will run their own loop, or watching more than a few lanes | [Lane dispatch](references/lane-dispatch.md) |
| Dispatch is authorized and needed | [Delegation](../pabcd/references/delegation.md) |
| Waiting on dispatched work or long external processes, HITL or HOTL | [Waiting on work](references/waiting.md) |

The installed skill listing and owner routers are the discovery path. crw skill
search searches external catalogs; it is not the native installed-skill loader.
Keep explicit-only skills and leaf-safe delivery restrictions intact.

## Execution invariants

- DISPATCH-SURFACE-01 (STRICT): name the surface before fanning work out, because
  two mechanisms answer to "dispatch" and they are not substitutes. A **subagent**
  (`spawn_agent`) is a leaf that runs in **this session's own working directory**,
  with no session state, no goal and no FSM; its edits land in your checkout as
  your uncommitted changes. A **thread** (`create_thread`) is a separate Codex
  task with its own goal and PABCD state, and with `environment: worktree` its own
  checkout — `environment: local` shares the project checkout instead. Work that
  needs its own branch, checkout, or merge/CI lane is thread work: N parallel lanes
  means N worktree threads, and the workers inside each lane are that lane's
  subagents, not threads of their own. Spawning N subagents for N branches puts
  N writers on one HEAD. Concurrent subagents need non-overlapping write scopes
  and must never run branch-level git operations at the same time. A request for
  parallel branch or worktree lanes **is** the user request that creating those
  threads needs — the lanes are the mechanism the work requires, so do not
  downgrade them onto the shared tree to avoid creating tasks. If the shape is
  unclear, ask once naming what you would create, then continue.
  Details and the measured evidence: [Dispatch surfaces](../pabcd/references/dispatch-surfaces.md).
- ORCH-MANDATE-01 (STRICT): a claimed active loop needs real persisted FSM evidence,
  not narrated phase names. Read actual session state before entry or re-entry.
  SESSION-IDENTITY-01 uses your current SessionStart binding, corroborated with
  `crw relay session current` when native CODEX_THREAD_ID is available. For a missing,
  inherited or conflicting line, use `crw relay session current` then explicit
  `crw relay session bind` in the verified native cwd. Never set that environment ID,
  replay hook JSON or borrow a parent's/history ID. Binding does not verify hooks.
  If PATH resolves an older development CLI, invoke this installed plugin's
  `node "<pluginRoot>/bin/crw.mjs"` for these commands; preserve the development checkout.
  Phase-control details belong to crw-pabcd.
- HOTL needs both an ACTIVE host goal and an in-flight PABCD cycle; HITL needs no
  host goal. If a required capability or binding is absent, report the preflight
  failure rather than claiming Stop-continuation is armed.
- One work-phase is one P→A→B→C→D cycle. Do the work and provide each edge's real
  artifact; state advancement is not proof of work. D closes that cycle to IDLE.
  Hooks may guard calls or termination; they neither choose nor advance phases.
- LOOP-CONTINUE-01: read the bound goalplan and ledger after D or context loss.
  Do not shrink criteria to exit. If in-scope work remains under the active goal,
  re-enter P. A genuinely new in-scope unit is a P-phase amendment to the same
  goal (LOOP-UNIT-CHAIN-01), not an excuse to stop or permission for unrelated work.
- LOOP-CONTINUITY-01: the next P quotes the previous D conclusion and direction;
  changing that direction requires a reason. Resume from durable evidence, not
  transcript momentum. Completion follows crw-dev's fresh-proof gate.
- LOOP-GIT-01 points to crw-dev §5: checkpoint authorized implementation locally;
  external writes still require explicit permission. For a declared PR stack,
  read crw-dev references/stacked-prs.md. Planning-only work does not authorize
  implementation or publication; local documentation checkpoints follow crw-dev
  scope and git rules.

## Docs-first multi-cycle entry

LOOP-DOCS-FIRST-01 is DEFAULT for multi-cycle loops and STRICT for HOTL.
Register the goalplan skeleton and make the first work-phase a docs-only roadmap
PABCD cycle. Its D locks the roadmap; implementation begins in the next cycle.
Each later work-phase consumes one pre-written decade doc and revalidates it at P.
If multi-cycle scope is discovered later, the next P first pays the roadmap debt.
No production patches, deploys, or implementation-complete claims in that cycle.
A genuine single-cycle task skips this extra cycle; crw-dev's C0/C1 fast-path remains.

LOOP-READS-PABCD-01 (STRICT): before multi-cycle execution read the implementation
units reference. crw-loop owns WHEN; crw-pabcd owns DIFFLEVEL-ROADMAP-01,
PHASE-SPLIT-01, LEXICO-SPLIT-01, and UNIT-RESIDENCE-01. crw-dev owns the C0/C1
fast-path exception. Neither a skeleton nor empty decade docs satisfy the roadmap.

## Completion and recovery

Report the real outcome: DONE, NOOP, BLOCKED, UNSAFE, NEEDS_HUMAN, or
BUDGET_EXHAUSTED. These are report outcomes, not new FSM phases or host goal
statuses. DONE requires fresh proof of all recorded criteria. Resource exhaustion
requires an actual stated bound; compaction, a wait timeout, or Stop releasing is
not success or budget exhaustion. Preserve evidence and continue when appropriate.
Do not weaken the goalplan to pass GOAL-COMPLETE-GATE-01. For rejection, stagnation,
or lost arming, read runtime lifecycle; for repeated failures read loop engineering.
