# Visual documents — compose, render, deliver

Turn the reader's question and supplied facts into a useful visual artifact.
`crw-dev-visualizer` is the entrypoint. Use `crw-dev`
for scope, work class and verification; a document request does not automatically
require a development loop. This skill owns artifact composition and delivery.
`dev-uiux-design` owns broader design judgment, `dev-frontend` owns frontend
implementation, and available format-specific skills own document mechanics.

**VIZ-SCOPE-01 — caller-scoped artifacts, upstream-first maintenance.** Shared
visualizer fixes are implemented and verified in codexclaw first, then adapted to
the standalone `aside-visualizer` repository. For explicitly requested maintenance,
follow [the port workflow](reference/port-maintenance.md); an upstream merge alone
does not close a downstream issue. This direction does not authorize maintenance
while answering an ordinary artifact request or duplicate Aside's roadmap here.
Within crw the skill has no independent mandate either. It composes and verifies
the artifact the calling task asked for, under that task's plan and verification gate.
It does not open a repository of its own, install itself or its scripts as a
prerequisite, publish, deploy, upload or open an artifact nobody requested, or start a
loop of its own. When something beyond the requested artifact looks necessary, say so
and let the caller decide.

## Start with the requested outcome

Infer the audience, question to answer, source material and output format from
context. Ask only for missing information that materially changes the result.
For “문서 만들어줘” with no format constraint, a readable HTML document is a
reasonable stated assumption. “visualize” in a conversation usually needs a
focused explanation. Neither phrase grants permission to publish or install.

- Preserve a named format, existing template, branding, section order and required
  contents. A DOCX request ends with DOCX; HTML can be a preview, not a substitute.
- Read supplied data and documents before designing. Distinguish observations,
  user-provided figures, assumptions and illustrative data. Never invent facts
  to populate a chart. Retain sources, dates, units and uncertainty where relevant.
- A requested Markdown table or text-only answer stays Markdown/text. A visual
  earns its space by clarifying a relationship, comparison or decision.
- Match document scale to content: one figure can be enough; reports need narrative,
  evidence and conclusions. Do not turn every request into a dashboard or slide deck.

## Select a route; read only what it needs

| Requested result | Authoring route | Read when selected |
|---|---|---|
| In-conversation comparison, simulation or explainer | Current host's exposed `visualize` skill, if available | Its current full SKILL.md; [delivery](reference/environment-detection.md) |
| Small static structure expressible as labeled nodes/edges | Mermaid if host supports it; otherwise a suitable artifact | [SVG and interaction](reference/svg-and-interaction.md) only for custom output |
| Editable SVG diagram or infographic | Native SVG with legible geometry and text | [Visual design](reference/visual-design.md), [SVG and interaction](reference/svg-and-interaction.md) |
| HTML report, technical brief, visual review or document | Semantic HTML with purposeful figures and readable sections | [Reader documents](reference/reader-documents.md), [Visual design](reference/visual-design.md), [documents/PDF](reference/document-pdf.md) |
| Multi-page report for a decision maker (client report, research report, proposal, 보고서) | [Report writing](reference/report-writing.md) storyline first, then [paged-report.html](assets/paged-report.html) exported with `scripts/export-paged-report.mjs` | [Report writing](reference/report-writing.md), [Documents/PDF](reference/document-pdf.md) REPORT-PRINT-01/QA-01 and the CJK recipe, [Visual design](reference/visual-design.md) REPORT-DESIGN-01/VIZ-01 |
| Interactive HTML model | One useful visual plus requested inputs that change it | [SVG and interaction](reference/svg-and-interaction.md), design reference if styling is open |
| PDF, print report or handout | Choose an available print/PDF engine; actually export | [Reader documents](reference/reader-documents.md), [Documents/PDF](reference/document-pdf.md); current PDF skill if available |
| Word/Google Docs, Slides/PPTX or spreadsheet | Available format-specific owner; use this skill for visual composition | [Documents/PDF](reference/document-pdf.md) for boundaries |
| Scientific figure intended for export/publication | Standard plotting tools and vector/raster artifact | Design/label principles here; scientific tool's own workflow |
| Website, app page or existing component change | Frontend owner and project conventions; Sites if required by the project | This skill only for embedded explanatory artifacts |

No tool or companion skill is assumed installed. Inspect available capabilities;
if a required exporter is absent, deliver the useful editable source and identify
the missing requested output. Never call print-ready HTML a generated PDF.

## Report evidence, language and analytical exhibits

For a report that answers research questions, use the existing model and
[research handoff](reference/report-pipeline.md); source-only intake performs no
retrieval. Preserve unknown provenance and unanswered questions. For English or
bilingual output, use [English authoring](reference/english-authoring.md), choose
source/output languages separately, and preserve values and qualifications. Choose
[exhibit recipes](reference/exhibit-recipes.md) by question and evidence; a table
or prose is valid. These are report tools, not prerequisites for a simple HTML edit.

## Compose before styling

Start from the reader contract and document type in
[Reader documents](reference/reader-documents.md), then run a compact design
read: **reader → question → information structure → visual encoding →
type/color/spacing → output constraints**. State the chosen direction
briefly when it helps the user evaluate an open brief. Reuse existing design tokens.

[Visual design](reference/visual-design.md) supplies distinct optional directions
and composition recipes. Select a coherent set for this artifact. Borrow principles
from several references, then reconcile them: one type hierarchy, one spacing rhythm,
consistent semantic colors, a deliberate level of detail. A source's trend or star
count is not a design requirement.

Examples of structure that earns its form:

- Explain a mechanism with actions on connectors and a caption stating what changes.
- Compare alternatives on the same dimensions and scale, with a table for exact values.
- Pick the genre first: decision memo, research synthesis, explanation or history,
  how-to or reference. It selects the structure and the review questions
  (REPORT-STORY-00). Evidence goes in an appendix in every genre.
- Decision documents and explanations follow [Reader documents](reference/reader-documents.md):
  answer first, headings that state findings. A research synthesis instead ends at what
  is unresolved, and a reference ends at the definitions — neither owes the reader an ask.
- A report over about four pages follows [Report writing](reference/report-writing.md):
  write the storyline before any HTML, make every section heading carry that unit's
  content, give the summary a full page that stands alone, number and source every
  exhibit, hold one register, and name the issuing organization the way the reader knows
  it. Cover and contents pages are part of the document, not decoration.
- For a dense system, use overview plus focused detail rather than shrinking every label.

Keep document narrative in the document. Inline conversation visuals instead obey
the host's narrower composition contract; do not paste a whole report into a fragment.

## Build the smallest complete artifact

Use semantic, editable source. Keep text-bearing HTML in normal responsive Grid/Flex
flow; derive SVG connector endpoints from rendered bounds if needed
(**DIAGRAM-LAYOUT-01**). Paint connectors before labels they pass behind. A label
placed on a connector needs a paper-coloured halo with `paint-order: stroke`, or
it must move clear; a halo cannot cover a connector painted later. Standalone SVG
is a vector document: geometric coordinates are appropriate, but size/wrap labels
from actual text metrics and inspect the result.

[editorial-report.html](assets/editorial-report.html) is an optional original,
dependency-free example for reports with a live scenario and print output. Adapt
its content and visual direction; it is not a mandatory template or a finished
report about the user's data. See the document reference for export readiness.
[paged-report.html](assets/paged-report.html) is the A4 report skeleton set as a
publication (REPORT-DESIGN-01: hairlines and type, one accent, a data chart, no
cards or tinted boxes): cover, contents with page numbers, summary page, flowing
body with claim headings and numbered exhibits, appendix and notice, with a
house-style token block at the top. Its company and numbers are fictional.
`scripts/export-paged-report.mjs <in.html> <out.pdf>` prints it with a local
Chromium, fills the contents page numbers in a second pass and reports layout
findings; `--qa-only <pdf>` audits a PDF from any engine.

Prefer native HTML/CSS/SVG and existing libraries. For library-dependent visuals,
verify actual versions and APIs, use authorized pinned assets, and distinguish
“one HTML file” from “works offline.” Do not execute retrieved HTML/JS or insert
untrusted strings as executable markup. Preserve dependency/font notices when copying.

The legacy `reference/html-templates.md` and `scripts/diagram-to-html.sh` remain
optional compatibility samples, **not the normal authoring route**. Their dark-theme,
CDN and environment defaults are not requirements. The shell helper wraps trusted
local content, is not a sanitizer or inline-fragment generator, and needs an explicit
authorized output path for durable delivery. Do not install it as a prerequisite.

## Verify in proportion to what can break

**VIZ-VERIFY-SCALE-01 — the proof matches the failure it would catch.** Rendering an
artifact and reading the result costs a round trip, and much of what this skill
produces cannot fail out of sight: the reader sees an inline visual before a
screenshot could reach you, and a static page in normal flow shows its own text.
Spend the round trip where the visible result is computed rather than written.

| Delivering | Before delivery |
|---|---|
| An inline visual in this conversation, or a fenced diagram the host renders | Reread the source once and send it. The reader's screen is the render. |
| A small static HTML/SVG page in ordinary flow — prose, tables, hand-placed shapes, no runtime data, no library, no export | Reread the source, save it, return the link. |
| Anything whose visible result is computed — marks drawn from data, connector geometry derived from rendered bounds, a runtime library or webfont, an input that changes the output | DIAGRAM-RENDER-VERIFY-01 in full. |
| PDF, print output, or a multi-page paged report | DIAGRAM-RENDER-VERIFY-01 with a stated assurance profile. Merely saving or sharing a simple static HTML/SVG file does not promote it to this tier. |

Two rules hold in every tier. An unrun check is never written up as a passed one:
"not rendered — static HTML in normal flow" is honest, "verified" is not. And a
defect promotes the artifact: once the reader reports something wrong, or a first
render shows it, render each further fix before sending it. Nothing here is enforced
by a hook, and the calling task's own verification gate still governs its work.

**DIAGRAM-RENDER-VERIFY-01 — for the computed and exported tiers, and for any
artifact you have reason to doubt:** render the final artifact, read the
screenshot/page, fix clipping, collisions, empty charts and runtime errors. Inspect
the longest labels at narrow and wide widths appropriate to the artifact; for
responsive HTML include 320/736px and the intended desktop size. SVG text must remain
legible at its intended display/export sizes, not merely within a valid viewBox.

The paged-report exporter may run a bounded `--dump-dom` SVG crossing diagnostic
on the final filled HTML. It is supplementary P2 review evidence: a crossing is
a review finding, while a timeout, malformed result, or sampling cap is recorded
in `report.notes` and does not change the PDF verdict; the PDF page remains the
authority for print inspection.

For interaction, change the primary input and observe the resulting marks/values;
exercise keyboard access and reset when provided. A static screenshot is not
interaction proof. For PDF, inspect the **actual exported pages**, including
multipage tables, final content, Korean glyphs and selected scenario state.
Print CSS or a PDF filename alone proves nothing. For a delivered PDF/print/paged report, run the
export script's QA (REPORT-QA-01) and the fresh-reader check on the rendered pages
(REPORT-FRESH-01); an orphan line at the top of a page, a heading stranded at the
bottom, a half-empty page or a figure whose text prints under 8.5pt is a defect.

How much of that verification a PDF/print/paged report owes is a **choice stated up front**, not a
fixed tax. Reading every rendered page is expensive, and a draft does not earn it.
Pick a receipt profile — `draft`, `standard` or `publication` — per
[report pipeline](reference/report-pipeline.md) REPORT-ASSURANCE-01, and report the
verdict with the profile and the checks it omitted. A lighter profile is honest; a
draft presented as a verified publication is not.

**DIAGRAM-SYNTAX-01:** use an existing supported parser/checker where available.
XML validation can catch malformed SVG; it cannot catch overlapped labels. Do not
invent a Mermaid CLI parse command or install a runner just for incidental proof.

**DIAGRAM-A11Y-01:** provide names/descriptions, meaningful heading order, data/text
alternatives, visible keyboard focus, non-color meaning, readable contrast and
reduced motion where applicable. These are composition decisions and apply to the
smallest inline visual. The separate inspection pass — reading actual contrast and
reading order in the rendered result — belongs to the tiers that already render;
adding ARIA does not establish accessibility conformance either way.

## Deliver and retain provenance

Save deliverables to a durable, authorized task-owned directory. Return a clickable
absolute file link for a requested standalone artifact. Use the current host's exact
content-reference contract for inline output. Only say it opened, rendered, exported
or published when that outcome was observed. Describe the useful result concisely.

[Source patterns](reference/source-patterns.md) records the GitHub references,
observed dates, licensing and adopted/rejected ideas. Read it when borrowing further
material or refreshing the skill, not for every small diagram. Existing
`reference/visualize-contract.md` and `upstream/` are historical snapshots/maintenance
aids. The current exposed host skill wins; a snapshot cannot grant renderer support.
