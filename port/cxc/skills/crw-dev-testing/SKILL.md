# Testing & QA
Balance: ~40% Backend/API, ~40% Frontend/E2E (Playwright), ~20% Cross-cutting (CI, Security, TDD, Coverage) -- directional guidance, not a hard ratio.
**Scope**: test harnesses, fixtures, mock policy, runners, Playwright, CI gates, coverage. Root-cause analysis and debugging playbooks → `dev-debugging`.
- This skill owns test adequacy; `dev-code-reviewer` owns finding severity and review process.
- CI pipeline ownership and deployment verification: see `dev-devops`.
- Data pipeline testing and ETL validation: see `dev-data`.
- Design direction context for rendered verification: see `dev-uiux-design`.
This skill activates by change-surface when work needs verification depth, regression coverage, or a reproducible test harness.

> **C0/C1 work (small local patches):** See `dev` §0.0 Work Classifier + §0.1 Patch Fast-Path before reading references.

> **`dev` is canonical:** `dev` §0.2 Rule Classes, §3 Verification Gate, and §5 Safety Rules apply to all work governed by this skill.

## 1. Test Strategy
### 1.1 Models
| Model | Best For | Emphasis |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Test Pyramid | monoliths, libraries | speed, isolation |
| **Testing Trophy** | modern web apps, REST backends | confidence-to-cost |
| Test Honeycomb | microservices, async systems | boundary verification |

### 1.2 Recommended Trophy Distribution
| Layer | Default Share | Typical Tools |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Static analysis | base layer | `tsc`, ESLint, mypy, Ruff |
| Unit | ~25% | Vitest, Jest, pytest |
| **Integration** | **~50%** | Supertest, httpx, Testcontainers |
| Contract | ~10% | Pact, OpenAPI validators, Schemathesis |
| E2E | ~10% | Playwright |
| Manual / exploratory | ~5% | human review |
### 1.3 Risk-First Priorities
1. auth / session / permission boundaries
2. money movement, quota, credits
3. data mutation and irreversible actions
4. file upload / parsing / external webhooks
5. shared API contracts used by frontend clients
6. error paths, retries, rollback behavior
### 1.4 Harness Selector
| Problem | Primary Harness | Avoid |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| pure business rule | unit / service test | browser test |
| route + middleware + serialization | API integration test | mocking the route itself |
| DB query / migration / transaction | real DB integration test | fake repository for SQL correctness |
| frontend consuming backend JSON | contract test | manual-only verification |
| rendered critical flow | Playwright smoke | asserting internal React state |
### 1.5 General Rules
- Write tests for **new features, bug fixes, refactors, and behavior changes**.
- Prefer **one behavioral concern per test**.
- Use factories / builders for setup; avoid repeated inline blobs.
- A fast real dependency beats a mock. A mock beats an untested branch.
- If the failure is mysterious, **delegate methodology to `dev-debugging`**, then return here for the regression harness.
- **STRICT (TEST-ANTI-FLAKE-01):** A time-based flake is a bug. Do not use sleep-based synchronization, retry-as-fix, or green-on-retry acceptance without a deterministic cause and harness correction. Full policy: `references/ci-pipeline.md` §5 (`TEST-FLAKE-*`).
- Verification depth follows `dev` §3 `DEV-VERIFY-FLOOR-01`; CRUD per-operation negative coverage is owned by `references/core/crud-test-matrix.md`.

## Limited-Oracle / Score-Objective Evaluation
For scarce, paid, rate-limited, or opaque evaluators, route to
`references/limited-oracle-evaluation.md` for all proxy-score gates.
### 1.6 Property-Based & Mutation Testing (verified 2026-07-02)

| Technique | Use for | Default tools | When |
|-----------|---------|---------------|------|
| Property-based | Pure logic, parsers, serializers, state machines, API invariants | fast-check (TS), Hypothesis (Python) | DEFAULT for invariant-heavy code |
| Mutation | Judging test-suite strength on critical logic/validators/security branches | Stryker (JS/TS), mutmut (Python) | Selective, after stable unit/property tests |

- Vitest 4 is the current runner baseline: Browser Mode is stable (visual regression `toMatchScreenshot`, Playwright trace generation, `expect.schemaMatching`).

## 2. Backend & API Testing
> Deep reference: `references/backend-testing.md`
### 2.1 Coverage Map
| Layer | Verify | TypeScript Default | Python Default |
|-------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Service layer | validation, orchestration, domain errors | Vitest | pytest |
| API layer | status, envelope, middleware, auth | Supertest | httpx / ASGITransport |
| Repository layer | SQL / ORM correctness | Testcontainers + real DB | Testcontainers + real DB |
| Background jobs | idempotency, retry, dead-letter | Vitest + fake clock | pytest + monkeypatch |
### 2.2 Mock Strategy Hierarchy
```text
real deterministic dependency
→ Testcontainers / ephemeral infra
→ recorded responses / thin fake
→ manual stub / fake
→ framework mock as last resort
```
### 2.3 Service & API Patterns
Mock dependencies at service boundaries. Use Supertest/httpx for route-level integration tests. Match response envelope shape from backend contracts.
### 2.4 Database Truth with Testcontainers
Use a **real database** when verifying migrations, transactions, unique constraints, foreign keys, query translation, and performance-sensitive SQL. Use Testcontainers for real DB truth in correctness-sensitive persistence tests. Start container in beforeAll/fixture setup, capture connection URI.
### 2.5 Fixture / Seed Synchronization
- Prefer builders / factories over copied JSON snapshots.
- Keep shared contract examples in `fixtures/contracts/` or equivalent.
- Seed data should expose **stable IDs** used by Playwright smoke flows.
- If frontend mocks drift from backend fixtures, write or update a **contract test first**.
---
## 3. Contract Testing
Contract tests protect the **frontend↔backend boundary**. They sit between API tests and browser tests.
**Rule**: Playwright proves the experience. Contract tests prove the shared shape.
### 3.1 Contract-Stable Surface
- response envelope: `success`, `data`, `error`, `meta`
- error taxonomy: HTTP status + machine-readable `error.code`
- pagination fields, auth headers, cookie behavior
- `requestId` propagation
- nullability, timestamps, enums, money serialization
### 3.2 Contract Options
| Style | Best For | Tooling |
|-------|----------|---------|
| consumer-driven contract | rapidly changing frontend/backend teams | Pact |
| schema-first contract | OpenAPI-led backends | OpenAPI validators, Schemathesis |
| type-level contract | TS monorepos | shared types / codegen |
| full-stack smoke | final user confidence | Playwright |
### 3.3 Consumer Contract — TypeScript (Pact / PactV4)
`PactV4` (aliased `Pact`) is the current interface (Pact Specification v4); treat `PactV3` as the legacy spec-v3 API. Workflow:
1. Define interaction: provider state + request + expected response (use `MatchersV3` for flexible matching)
2. Execute test against Pact mock server
3. Assert consumer expectations
4. Pact file auto-writes to `pacts/` → publish to broker → provider verifies

See `references/backend-testing.md` for a full example.
### 3.4 Schema Verification
Use schema-based API testing (Schemathesis) to verify OpenAPI/GraphQL contract compliance. (Dredd is legacy/inactive — do not adopt for new projects.)
### 3.5 Rules
- Contract tests are **strongly recommended** for parallel FE/BE, public APIs, and cross-team contracts.
- E2E success does **not** replace provider verification.
- Store golden examples near the contract, not inside one app only.
- If the shape is intentionally breaking, update the contract first, then all consumers.
---
## 4. Playwright Browser Testing
Use Playwright after API and contract tests are already trustworthy. Browser tests should validate rendered flows, accessibility-critical interactions, and real integration seams that lower layers cannot prove alone.
**Helper Scripts Available**:
- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)
Run scripts with `--help` first — treat as black boxes to avoid context window pollution.
### 4.1 Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach
```
User task → Static HTML? → Read file → find selectors → write Playwright script
         → Dynamic app? → Server running? → No: `python scripts/with_server.py --help`
                                           → Yes: Recon-then-action (navigate → screenshot → selectors → act)
```
### 4.2 Example: Using with_server.py
```bash
# Single server:
python scripts/with_server.py --server "npm run dev" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py

# Multiple servers:
python scripts/with_server.py \
  --server "cd backend && python server.py" --port 3000 \
  --server "cd frontend && npm run dev" --port 5173 \
  -- python your_automation.py
```
### 4.3 Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern
1. Wait for an explicit app-ready signal or locator assertion → 2. Screenshot/inspect DOM → 3. Identify selectors → 4. Execute actions

### 4.4 Best Practices
- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** — run `--help` first, invoke directly.
- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts; always close the browser.
- Prefer locator-based interactions and web-first assertions: `expect(page.get_by_role("button", name="Save")).to_be_visible()`, then `click()` on that locator.
- Prefer user-facing locators, especially `get_by_role()` with an accessible name. Use `get_by_label()`, `get_by_placeholder()`, or `get_by_test_id()` when role/name cannot express the target.
- Avoid `networkidle`, hard sleeps, and `wait_for_timeout()` in tests. Wait on observable app-ready signals, locator actions, or `expect()` assertions.
- **AI-authored tests (DEFAULT):** Playwright MCP / Test Agents are generation-and-repair aids only — final acceptance still requires deterministic locators, web-first assertions, traces, and a human-readable failure artifact.
### 4.5 Reference Files
- **examples/** - Examples showing common patterns:
  - `element_discovery.py` - Discovering buttons, links, and inputs on a page
  - `static_html_automation.py` - Using file:// URLs for local HTML
  - `console_logging.py` - Capturing console logs during automation
### 4.6 Browser Testing Rules
- Run **contract tests and API tests first** for broken-data bugs.
- Use Playwright for **rendered truth**, not as a replacement for service tests.
- Prefer one smoke flow per critical path over many brittle micro-flows.
- If a failure looks like data-shape drift, go back to **§2 Backend & API Testing** or **§3 Contract Testing**.
### 4.7 Exploratory browser QA (TEST-CU-QA-01)

Browser QA loads `dev-frontend` for rendered implementation context.
Follow [portable browser routing](../crw-dev/references/browser-routing.md)
(QA-TOOL-LADDER-01). Suitable available Aside, native browsers, and agbrowse may
drive built UI; no one optional tool is required. Inspect -> act -> re-inspect,
exercise the promised interaction, and retain the state/result evidence.
Repository-owned Playwright suites remain the deterministic regression path.
Load `crw-qa` for scenario matrices, adversarial/oracle passes, and teardown.
Missing tool/access -> report the gap, never mark an unperformed check passed.

## 5. CI Pipeline Integration
> Full workflow templates: `references/ci-pipeline.md`
### 5.1 Pipeline Order
`quality -> unit/integration -> contract -> Playwright E2E -> security -> coverage/artifacts`
See `references/ci-pipeline.md` for job dependencies, concurrency, matrices, sharding,
Playwright dependencies, and full GitHub Actions/GitLab CI templates.
Matrix only across supported runtimes, required OS behavior, or suites exceeding CI budget.
### 5.4 Flaky Test Remediation
A flake is a defect, not a category of test. `TEST-FLAKE-ELIMINATE-01`,
`TEST-FLAKE-RERUN-01`, `TEST-FLAKE-QUARANTINE-01`, and
`TEST-FLAKE-ATTRIBUTION-01` are canonical in `references/ci-pipeline.md` §5 —
read it before treating any flake, including deciding whether one is
"environmental".
### 5.5 CI-Green Loop
**STRICT (TEST-CI-GREEN-01):** Latest HEAD is the source of truth. Inspect the
failing job and artifacts before editing, make the minimal correct fix, run local
verification when it reduces next-fail risk, then re-watch the latest HEAD.
Repeat until green; never blind-retry a failed job or push another change without
new failure evidence.
### 5.6 Rules
- Do not let Playwright be the **only** blocking job.
- Contract tests should run **before** browser tests.
- Upload artifacts for failures: coverage, junit, traces, screenshots.
- Fail the build on broken thresholds, not only test exit codes.
---
## 6. TDD Enforcement Mode
When `ENFORCE_TDD=true` is set in project instructions or explicitly requested, this section becomes mandatory.
### 6.1 RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
1. **RED** — write the failing test first and verify it fails for the right reason.
2. **GREEN** — write the minimum implementation to pass.
3. **REFACTOR** — clean up after green, then rerun the affected suite.
### 6.2 Self-Audit Checklist
| Check | Pass Criteria |
|-------|--------------|
| Test written before implementation? | test file added / updated before or with code |
| Failure observed before fix? | red state was actually executed |
| Behavior-focused assertions? | checks outputs, side effects, contracts |
| Regression locked in? | failing case is now protected by a persistent test |
### 6.3 Vertical Tracer-Bullet TDD
Prefer one behavior test → minimal implementation → next behavior. Slice by something
a user, caller, or consuming module can observe, not by horizontal layers such as "DB",
"API", then "UI". Assert through public interfaces and durable contracts. Retire shallow
scaffolding tests when a stronger interface or acceptance test covers the same promise.
### 6.4 Default Style
| Style | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| London / mockist | orchestration-heavy boundaries |
| Chicago / classicist | domain logic and transforms |
| **Hybrid** | most production code |
Default to **Hybrid**: mock external systems, keep internal collaboration real unless it becomes too slow or unstable.
### 6.5 Boundary with dev-debugging
- `dev-testing` owns the **regression harness** and enforcement loop.
- `dev-debugging` owns **root-cause methodology** once a failure is mysterious or multi-layered.
- After `dev-debugging` isolates the cause, come back here to lock it in with tests.

## 6.6 AI-Assisted Development Regressions

When an AI writes and reviews its own code, it carries the same assumptions into both steps. Automated tests break this feedback loop.

### Common AI Regression Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Test Strategy |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Sandbox/production mismatch | Fix applied to one code path, not both | Assert same response shape in both modes |
| SELECT clause omission | New field in response but missing from DB query | Assert all required fields are present and defined |
| Error state leakage | Error set but stale data not cleared | Assert state cleanup on error transitions |
| Missing rollback | Optimistic UI update without recovery on failure | Assert state restoration after simulated API error |

### Regression Naming Convention

Name regression tests with BUG-R{N} convention. Assert all required fields with a loop.

### Sandbox-Mode API Testing

When the project supports a sandbox/mock mode, use it for fast DB-free regression testing:
- Force sandbox mode in test setup: `process.env.SANDBOX_MODE = 'true'`
- Assert sandbox responses match the same contract as production responses.
- Treat sandbox/production parity as a high-priority regression target.
- In sandbox/spike mode, write tests for bugs found — coverage grows organically. For production refactors, see §1.5 (tests required for behavior changes).

---
## 6.7 Test-Induced Production Defense Detection

**Rule:** Do not add production defensive code solely to satisfy unrealistic tests. A production guard is allowed only when the invalid state can occur at a real boundary or represents an explicit domain rule.

| Production change smell | Likely test problem | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Internal `if (!x) return` added after unit test fails | Test fixture omitted required field | Fix fixture factory or test boundary validation |
| Required field made optional to satisfy test | Test is using invalid domain object | Restore required type and update test data |
| Catch-all added so test passes | Test expects silence instead of failure | Assert typed error or user-visible failure |
| Production default added for impossible state | Test bypassed constructor/parser | Use real constructor/parser in test |
| Private helper exported only for test | Test is coupled to implementation | Test public behavior or move helper to test support |
| Sleep/retry added only for test flake | Test lacks deterministic synchronization | Wait on observable condition or fake clock |
| `NODE_ENV === "test"` branch added | Test-only production behavior | Remove branch; improve test harness |

**Required questions before adding a guard:**
1. Is the input from an untrusted boundary? → If yes, validate at that boundary
2. Can this state happen in production? → If no, fix the test
3. What contract allows this value? → Cite schema/type/domain rule
4. Would this hide a real bug? → If yes, fail fast instead

**Banned patterns:** `process.env.NODE_ENV === "test"` branches, silent fallbacks for impossible internal state, making required types optional for mocks, exporting internals only for tests.

**Allowed guards:** Boundary validation (process/network/user/file boundary), backward compatibility (documented old schema), security checks, domain invariants, observed production bug regressions, external dependency adapters.

---
## 7. Accessibility Testing
### Component, Page, and CI Gates
- Run axe-core through jest-axe or vitest-axe on rendered components.
- Run `@axe-core/playwright` across every changed or critical route.
- Verify keyboard operation, visible focus, focus order, and focus restoration manually.
- Gate order: component axe -> page axe -> keyboard/focus checks.
- Block serious/critical axe violations; keep Lighthouse scores advisory.
### Observability Verification

Verify trace propagation in integration tests. Assert that spans appear for critical paths. Check structured log format matches the schema in `dev-backend/references/core/observability.md`.

---

## 8. Security Testing
**→ Delegated**: threat modeling and secure design policy belong to `dev-security`.
This section covers the **automated test hooks and CI gates** that enforce those rules.
`fast checks -> SAST -> dependency audit -> auth/validation regressions`
Use the repository's pinned audit and SAST products; detailed product setup belongs in
the security-testing reference or CI owner, not this router.
Test missing/insufficient auth and contract error codes on protected endpoints.
- Run dependency audit and SAST in CI.
- Add auth, permission, malicious-input, and malformed-input regressions.
- Block policy-defined high/critical findings; exceptions require owner and expiry.
## 9. Coverage & Quality Gates
### 9.1 Suggested Thresholds
These are project/risk-based, not universal minimums. Adjust for your context.

| Metric | Suggested Floor | Ideal |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Line coverage | 70% | 85%+ |
| Branch coverage | 60% | 80%+ |
| Function coverage | 80% | 90%+ |
| Diff coverage | 80% | 90%+ |
### 9.2 Outcome Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Defect detection rate | > 80% |
| Mean time to detect | < 1 CI run |
| Test signal-to-noise | > 95% |
| Contract drift rate | near 0 |
### 9.3 Coverage Workflow
1. generate coverage reports
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   npx vitest run --coverage
   pytest --cov --cov-report=xml
   ```
2. review by priority: auth, payment, mutations, upload, contracts first
3. write targeted tests for the gaps
4. publish artifacts and fail the merge when thresholds drop
### 9.4 Quality Gate Checklist
- [ ] focused unit / service tests
- [ ] API integration tests for changed routes
- [ ] contract tests for shared payload changes
- [ ] Playwright smoke for critical rendered journeys
- [ ] security scan / dependency scan
- [ ] coverage thresholds and diff coverage
- [ ] CI artifacts uploaded for failure analysis
---
## 10. Pre-Flight Test Checklist
Choose the smallest checklist that covers the work class and changed boundaries:
- [ ] C0/C1: focused test or smallest proof; no unrelated broad suite.
- [ ] C2: targeted unit/service plus affected API, contract, or rendered smoke.
- [ ] C3: affected suites, boundary negatives, contracts, and integration evidence.
- [ ] C4/release: full gates, security/data negatives, rollback or smoke proof.
- [ ] Fixtures are deterministic; real dependencies cover correctness-sensitive paths.
- [ ] External calls are intentionally mocked/recorded; no accidental live traffic.
- [ ] Changed errors/data contracts are asserted; shared fixtures remain synchronized.
- [ ] Flakes are diagnosed, not accepted through retry.
- [ ] CI jobs actually run and failure artifacts are retained.
- [ ] `ENFORCE_TDD` evidence exists when enabled.
- [ ] Coverage and security thresholds match repository policy.
## Acceptance-Row Reachability (TEST-ROW-REACHABLE-01, DEFAULT)

Every row of an acceptance-criteria table must have a CONSTRUCTIBLE precondition. Before
writing a row, ask: is there a call path that reaches this state? Does an earlier guard
consume this condition first, so the branch under test is never entered? Does an operation
that produces this value actually exist?

An unreachable row is decoration, not verification — the implementer tries to write that
test, cannot, and quietly drops it. This applies C-ACTIVATION-GROUNDING-01's requirement
(every conditional path names its activation scenario) to each row of the acceptance table,
not just to the plan's prose.

Common unreachable shapes:

- The row asserts a rejection that an earlier, broader rule already rejects — the specific
  guard is never exercised, so the test passes even if that guard is absent.
- The row needs a state the public API cannot produce (no op creates it).
- The row asserts on a call-site argument the function never receives.
- Two rows in the same table are mutually exclusive on the same tree (e.g. "the gate
  reports a failure here" plus "the gate exits 0 overall").

## Test Oracle Integrity (TEST-PROMPT-SEAM-01 / TEST-ORACLE-INDEPENDENCE-01 / TEST-PRECEDENCE-FIXTURE-01, DEFAULT)

Three narrow contracts that stop false-green. All three are **E7 prose — no gate enforces
them**; the reviewer is the only check.

**TEST-PROMPT-SEAM-01 (DEFAULT).** Do not assert on prose. A test may read a document only
when it EXTRACTS a value and COMPARES it against a value from another source. Asserting that
a phrase exists in a file is a violation no matter how many files you read or what the test's
header says it is for.

- Forbidden: `assert.match(readFileSync(".../SKILL.md"), /prefer rg first/i)` — one source,
  phrase existence, breaks on harmless rewording, proves no behavior.
- Allowed: parse the frontmatter `description`, pull the model token out of it, and
  `assert.ok(NATIVE_OPENAI_MODELS.includes(token))` — two sources, values compared, breaks
  only when they genuinely disagree.
- Also allowed (outside this rule's scope): asserting on non-prose values — version pins,
  license names, runtime output, CLI stdout, hook payloads, file existence.

**The two known violations were deleted, not repaired (260726).**
`loop-activation-doc-sync.test.mjs` (10 assertions) and the doctrine test inside
`emergence-doc-sync.test.mjs` (24) both asserted phrase existence across skills, doctrine
documents and an archived HTML page. Three repair designs were tried and all three were
worse than deletion:

- A structured `metadata.contract` block in each skill, compared between them: nothing at
  runtime reads such a field, so it would have been a third source of truth that passes
  whenever both copies are wrong together.
- Promoting the activation prose to a behavioural test against `handleStop`: the five
  guard combinations are already owned by `hook-continuation.test.ts`, so this only
  duplicated coverage while appearing to offset the deletion.
- Promoting the collapse doctrine the same way: there is no runtime branch that
  implements a collapse point, so there is no value to compare against.

What that costs, stated plainly: the collapse-point doctrine, `crw-search`'s ownership of
the divergence `strong-1`/`add-1` provenance, and the archived falsifiability SOT now have
**no automated consistency check**. They are human-review items. The activation contract is
unaffected — `hook-continuation.test.ts` owns it and always did.

What survived: the tag-balance half of the emergence test counts opening tags against
closing ones, which is a value compared to a value rather than a phrase lookup. It moved to
`emergence-html-structure.test.mjs` and still runs.

The lesson worth citing: when prose has no counterpart in code, a test that reads it can
only check that the words are still there. Deleting it removes a false green; inventing a
second document to compare it against removes nothing and adds a lie.

**TEST-ORACLE-INDEPENDENCE-01 (DEFAULT).** Never derive the expected value from the code
under test.

- Forbidden: `assert.equal(fn(x), fn(x))`; building the expectation with a helper the DUT
  also uses; refreshing a snapshot from current output and calling that verification.
- Allowed: hardcode the expectation in the fixture, or compute it by an independent route
  (a second implementation, a hand-worked example, an external spec).

**TEST-PRECEDENCE-FIXTURE-01 (DEFAULT).** When testing override / default / fallback, the
three values must all DIFFER — otherwise the test cannot tell which path ran.

- Forbidden: override `"x"`, default `"x"`, fallback `"x"` — every branch passes.
- Allowed: override `"from-flag"`, default `"from-config"`, fallback `"builtin"`, and each
  case asserts the specific one.

A regression test should FAIL when the defect is reintroduced. Confirm it once by mutation —
break it, watch it go red, restore it, watch it go green.

## Patch Integrity Gate (TEST-PATCH-INTEGRITY-01, DEFAULT)

Source: sol research (SWE-bench containerized evaluation, addyosmani/agent-skills).

An agent that obtains green by weakening tests has not fixed the bug. Before
claiming implementation complete:

1. **Baseline**: record which tests fail and their failure signatures BEFORE any
   production code change.
2. **Implement**: write the fix/feature.
3. **Re-run originals**: execute the ORIGINAL test suite (not the modified version)
   against the patched source. All baseline failures must now pass.
4. **Classify test changes**: every test/config change is `required` (new test for
   new behavior), `suspicious` (deleted assertion, lowered threshold, added skip,
   reduced coverage exclusion), or `unrelated`.
5. **Justify suspicious changes**: each suspicious change needs a stated reason.
   "The test was wrong" is valid only with evidence of the original test's incorrectness.

Red flags that trigger escalation:
- Deleted assertions without replacement
- Snapshot updates without visual/behavioral verification
- Coverage exclusions added in the same PR as the fix
- `@skip` or `.skip()` added to failing tests — unless it is a `TEST-FLAKE-QUARANTINE-01` quarantine carrying all four required fields (`references/ci-pipeline.md` §5.3)
- Threshold reductions (e.g., coverage 80% → 60%)
- Type assertion suppressions (`as any`, `@ts-ignore`) in test files

## TDD Evidence Contract (TEST-TDD-EVIDENCE-01, DEFAULT)

When TDD is claimed, durable evidence must show:
- RED: failing test name + failure message (before production code)
- GREEN: same test passing (after production code)
- REFACTOR: full affected suite passing (after cleanup)

A TDD claim without RED evidence is not TDD.
